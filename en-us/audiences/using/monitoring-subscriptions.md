# Monitoring subscriptions

Monitoring subscriptions

Use the Adobe Campaign interface to track your subscribers and measure the success of your services.

You have several options for monitoring subscriptions to and unsubscriptions:

* View the list of people currently subscribed to your service from the service dashboard. See [Service dashboard](../../audiences/using/monitoring-subscriptions.md#service-dashboard).
* consult the history of subscriptions and unsubscriptions from the **Subscription history** tab in the service dashboard. See [Subscription history](../../audiences/using/monitoring-subscriptions.md#subscription-history).
* display a report detailing the evolution of subscriptions and unsubscriptions in the service **Reports**. See [Service reports](../../audiences/using/monitoring-subscriptions.md#service-reports).
* find the list of services a person has subscribed from its **Profile**. See [History of events linked to a profile](../../audiences/using/monitoring-subscriptions.md#history-of-events-linked-to-a-profile).

## Service dashboard

To view the list of people subscribed to a service:

1. Go to the list of services via the advanced menu **Profiles & audiences** > **Services**, which can be accessed from the Adobe Campaign logo.
1. Select the service of your choice to display the corresponding dashboard.
1. The list of people subscribed to the service can be found in the **Subscriptions** tab.
