# About emails

About emails

The email channel is one of the core channels in Adobe Campaign, allowing you to schedule and send personalized emails to specific targets.

You can send different types of emails:

* Single-send emails: basic emails that you can send once to a defined target.
* Recurring emails: send the same email regularly and aggregate each send and its reports on a periodic basis. A common example is a birthday email. Recurring emails are available through workflows only.
* A/B testing emails: test up to 3 versions of an email.
* Transactional emails: unitary emails that are triggered based on your customers' behavior.

To learn the best practices when creating and sending emails, consult the [Delivery best practices](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/getting_started/en/ACS_DeliveryBestPractices.html) step-by-step guide.
