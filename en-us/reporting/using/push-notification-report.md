# Push notification report

Push notification report

The **Push notification** report provides details related to push notifications. For example, delivered and open rates.

Each table is represented by summary numbers and charts. You can change how the details are shown in their respective visualization settings.

The first table, **Push summary**, displays the total number of sent, delivered, and opened push notifications.

The following two tables, **Mobile app repartition** and **Platform repartition**, contain the available data for push notifications. This data depends upon:

* The mobile applications used to send the push notifications.
* The recipients' mobile operating systems.
