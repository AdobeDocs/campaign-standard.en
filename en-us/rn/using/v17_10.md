# v17.10

10/26/2017

## Improvements

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Fatigue Management  | Fatigue Management allows you to create fatigue rules to manage over-communication with profiles. Fatigue rules are easily built, but are extremely flexible with capabilities such as counting messages across multiple channels (including transactional messages), only counting specific deliveries, or applying rules to specific profiles. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../administration/using/typologies.md#fatigue-rules).  |
|  Content creation: Import from a URL  | Import from a URL enables you to quickly retrieve your creative content from a website to build emails for any delivery. Additionally, you can streamline your creative process by enabling third parties to share content directly through a URL. Imported content can be flexibly used as part of a single delivery or at the template level ensuring brand consistency for all related campaigns whether they be workflow-based or transactional messages, and include A/B or multivariate testing. Import from a URL automatically converts and tracks all links to monitor email performance through Dynamic Reporting. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../designing/using/importing-html-content.md#importing-content-from-a-url).  |

## Patches

### Platform

* Fixed an issue that could prevent large zipped files from being correctly unzipped.
* Security in brand management has been improved. Modifying a brand's name and sender address is now reserved for Adobe technical administrators.
* To improve security, user generated content (images, mirror pages, landing pages, etc.) cannot be served by the adobe.com domain anymore. It is now mandatory that you use your own domain to handle these resources, via the use of branding.
* Fixed an interface issue when displaying and filtering marketing activities.
* Fixed an issue which prevented subscription date fields from being updated with a POST Rest API call.

### Emails, SMS messages and direct mail

* Fixed an issue that could prevent from targeting a list type audience in a message, causing the preparation to fail.
* Missing languages added in the multilingual email delivery capabilities.
* The content thumbnail, displayed on the delivery dashboard, is now automatically updated when the user modifies content and saves.
* Fixed a timezone related issue that prevented a delivery from being opened.

### Push notifications

* When configuring the push notification channel, the push provider platform value was hardcoded in the configuration file. The value corresponding to the mobile operating system is now a variable retrieved from the Marketing Cloud Mobile SDK.
* Fixed an error that prevented iOS mobile app from being added in the Adobe Campaign interface.
* Push notifications are now supported on both GCM and FCM-enabled Android mobile applications.
* Fixed an error that prevented content from being saved when duplicating a push notification template.
* It is now possible to create or update a profile from the Adobe Campaign database by reconciling mobile application users' data.
* Adobe Campaign now prioritizes processing the transactional push notifications over standard push notifications.

### Reports

* Fixed an issue that prevented the hot click percentages from being displayed in the email content.
* Fixed an issue witht the blacklist metric which was counted as a hard bounce instead of a bounce.
* Fixed an issue that led to negative counts being displayed in summary data.
* Fixed an issue that counted profiles in the wrong age segment.
* The soft and hard bounce calculation formulas have changed.

### Workflows

* Fixed an issue in the **Load file** activity that could lead to errors after manually adding and removing columns in the activity.
* The **deliverabilityUpdate** technical workflow is now scheduled to run at 2am, server time.
* Fixed a security issue that allowed to perform a list export without the export role.
* Fixed an issue with the **Reconciliation** activity. 
* Fixed an issue with the use of wildcard characters in the **File Transfer** activity.

### Profiles and audiences

* Fixed an issue that could prevent a condition of a query from being correctly taken into account in some specific cases, leading to erroneous results.
* Fixed an issue that could prevent profiles from being accessed if they were targeted in a message that was prepared but never sent and expired.

### Integrations

* Fixed an issue that could prevent some Data Sources created for Triggers from correctly showing up and being selected.

### Custom resources

* Fixed an issue that occurred in list screens where custom resource rows could be displayed without any data. 
* Fixed an issue that prevented boolean type fields with 'False' value from being displayed in custom resources.
