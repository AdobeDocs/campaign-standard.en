# v17.5

05/15/2017

## Improvements

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Direct mail  | Break through the digital barrier and connect to the physical world with Adobe Campaign Standardâ€™s first offline channel, Direct Mail. This feature allows you to personalize and generate the file required by direct mail providers as part of your cross-channel campaigns. Leverage Direct Mail to re-engage customers or to enhance the customer experience with a compelling tactile touchpoint driving customers to your app, website or store. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/about-direct-mail.md).  |
|  Email BCC  | Email BCC enables the saving of unique email messages sent to individual recipients, thus allowing the brand to archive those messages. By adding a BCC email address to all emails, Adobe Campaign Standard customers can keep an exact copy of each email with this feature. This is a common legal requirement for the financial services industry and is helpful in assisting customer service centers in resolving conflicts in real time. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../administration/using/email-configuration.md#email-bcc).  |
