# v15.6

07/01/2015

## <p>Improvements</p>

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Workflows: Reconciliation activity  | A new **Reconciliation** activity links unidentified data (for example, after importing a file) with existing resources within a workflow. This activity is essentially used for Data Management purposes. It responds to two different use cases: Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/reconciliation.md).  |
|  Workflows: Extract file activity  | A new **Extract file** activity allows you to export data from the Adobe Campaign database in the form of an external file from a workflow. Limitation: it is currently not possible to use dynamic names for output files. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/extract-file.md).  |
|  Workflows: Scheduler activity  | Improved widget that allows you to select the execution time of the **Scheduler** activity in a workflow.  |
|  Workflows: Transfer file activity  | SFTP is now supported.  |
|  Custom resources  | The **Development** menu now allows users with admin rights to enrich the data templates provided by creating their own custom resources, such as purchase or product tables. Out-of-the-box resources can also be extended in order to add new fields to them. In addition, navigation in the screens corresponding to new or extended custom resources can be configured. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../developing/using/data-model-concepts.md).  |
|  Test profiles  | The **Middle name** and **Title** of the test profiles can now be selected when configuring the list of test profiles.  |
|  Content editor: Dynamic content  | You can define different contents which will be displayed dynamically to the user according to the conditions defined via the expression editor. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../designing/using/defining-dynamic-content.md).  |
|  Email  | A **Test profiles** column is now available in an email's sending logs.  |
