# v17.7

07/10/2017

## <p>Improvements</p>

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Multilingual Campaigns with Experience Manager  | A unique end-to-end solution to solve the marketer’s operational challenges in conducting multilingual email campaigns by combining content creation, translation, and collaboration capabilities in AEM Sites with Multilingual Deliveries in Campaign. Centrally manage sophisticated content lifecycles with multiple contributors, automate multilingual email creation and publish approved content for automated campaign execution in one click. Ensure both your brand and message are consistent no matter what language the content is in as part of your streamlined content creation workflow for a faster time to market and increased ROI. Adobe Experience Manager and 3rd party machine or human translation services through AEM are required. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrating/using/creating-campaigns-and-emails-in-experience-manager-6_3.md).  |
|  Multilingual email and SMS deliveries  | Define and execute multilingual Email & SMS deliveries through a single delivery based on your automatically segmented customers' preferred language. Report on the performance of every delivery down to the language and individual levels. More and more companies are faced with the challenge of delivering content in multiple languages as they grow at home and abroad. As such, streamlining localized message delivery is a key part of an effective customer communication strategy for multinational companies; companies in countries with multiple languages; and companies who want to further personalize their content at the lingual level no matter where customers reside. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/creating-a-multilingual-email.md).  |
|  Adobe Campaign Notifications  | Receive notifications regarding important system activities directly within Adobe Campaign Standard. You will be notified, for example, on the progress of your on-going deliveries or when a workflow is in error. Real-time notifications keep relevant stakeholders informed and provide users with the ability to immediately and directly act on activity notifications from within the application. The result for teams is advanced agility, efficiency and smoother execution of campaigns. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../administration/using/adobe-campaign-notifications.md).  |
|  Delivery Alerting  | In addition to viewing notifications directly in Adobe Campaign Standard, Adobe Campaign now also provides an email alerting system to trigger email alerts to users or external stakeholders of important system activities. Create, manage, and receive customizable alerts and dashboards to keep track of delivery successes or failures. Adobe Campaign Delivery Alerting boosts efficiency by keeping all involved Adobe Campaign users in a company automatically informed about the delivery execution status, via email and dashboard. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../sending/using/delivery-alerting.md).  |
|  Encrypted Declared ID in Datasources  | Send Email and SMS triggers without the need for an existing profile in Campaign by using encrypted contact information (email address or phone number) as a Declared ID. Because Encrypted Declared IDs can be decoded by Adobe Campaign Standard, Campaign can now create new marketable profiles when receiving audiences from other Experience Cloud solutions containing previously unknown contacts. Target customers and unknown prospects in real-time through both email & SMS to improve loyalty in your existing customer base and acquire new customers respectively. Make the most of your first-party cookie data (from Adobe Audience Manager&#42;) once prospects authenticate and leverage those insights in Adobe Campaign. &#42;Adobe Audience Manager is required. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrating/using/about-people-core-service-integration.md).  |
|  KPI sharing from Campaign to Analytics  | Share campaign data with Adobe Analytics to measure email marketing metrics from Campaign alongside other marketing and advertising efforts through conversion, unifying pre- and post-click behavior. Track overall performance directly and uncover synergies with external programs in Analytics. Apply your learning from this consolidated view back into your campaigns; ultimately improving open, click-through and conversion rates boosting revenue and overall campaign performance. Adobe Analytics is required. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrating/using/about-adobe-analytics-integration.md).  |
|  Direct Mail Channel - Return To Sender  | Flat file exchanges with Direct Mail providers incorporating Return to Sender information are now supported. This enhancement to the Direct Mail channel allows corresponding postal addresses to be excluded from future communications. This enables marketers to be notified of an incorrect address and engage with the customer through other channels or to encourage him to update his postal address. This also reduces the number of wasted marketing dollars as marketers avoid sending mail to incorrect addresses. Direct Mail is available as an add-on channel. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/return-to-sender.md).  |

## <p>Patches</p>

### <p>General</p>

* Fixed an issue which let any user export lists. Now only users with the **Export** role are allowed to.

### <p>Emails, SMS messages and direct mail</p>

* Fixed an issue with the **updateDeliveryExecInfo** workflow that set the **To deliver** indicator to 0 for SMS deliveries.
* In the **Advanced parameters** of the delivery template’s properties, the **Routing** drop-down list now only displays external accounts corresponding to the template message type. For example, an email delivery template only displays email external accounts.
* Fixed an issue with the **Text** preferred email format defined for test profiles.
* Fixed an issue that led to a Javascript error in when selecting the default time zone in the schedule definition screen of a delivery.
* Fixed an issue which prevented traps from appearing in the sending logs.
* In the template selection screen of the delivery creation wizard, follow-up and A/B test templates are now hidden by default. For more information, refer to the [detailed documention](../../channels/using/creating-an-email.md).
* Fixed an issue which let any user send deliveries. Now only users with the **Start deliveries** role are allowed to. For more information, refer to the [detailed documention](../../sending/using/confirming-send.md).

### <p>Push notifications</p>

* Fixed an issue with the **Campaign Tracking Endpoint** URL that prevented reporting.
* Fixed an issue that prevented the push notification title to be displayed on Android devices.
* Fixed an issue that prevented the push notification to be displayed on iOS devices when the push notification contained only a title (and nothing in the body of the message).
* Fixed an issue that forced media attachment URLs in a delivery to be tracked, which prevented videos and pictures from being embedded in the delivery. The tracking of URLs of the type mediaAttachmentURL is now deactivated by default for push notifications.

### <p>Reports</p>

* Corrected an issue where values appeared different between charts and table.
* Corrected an issue that displayed push notification values as email values. 
* Fixed an issue that showed values as unknown when a delivery was created outside of a campaign. 
* Corrected an issue that showed SMS report data as mobile application data.

### <p>Workflows</p>

* You can now filter workflow logs (period of time and text search). For more information, refer to the [detailed documention](../../automating/using/executing-a-workflow.md#monitoring).
* An option is now available in worflow deliveries to deactivate the confirmation before the send.
* Fixed an issue which prevented you from setting an outbound transition in the creation wizard of recurring delivery.
* Fixed an issue that occurred when using a workflow query activity based on a custom resource field with an enumeration that had a lot of values
