# v16.5

05/26/2016

## Improvements

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Predefined filters  | Administrators can now create advanced filters that appear in the query editor in the form of pre-configured rules. Selecting those filters allows users to develop complex configurations more easily in a simplified interface when defining an audience, for example. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../developing/using/step-4--define-filters.md).  |
|  Workflows: Subscription Services  | A new **Subscription Services** activity offers the possibility of subscribing several profiles to a service or unsubscribing them from a service with in a single action. This activity can be used after having carried out a targeting or imported a file with identified data. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/subscription-services.md).  |
|  Workflows: data enrichment  | The **Additional data** tab is now available in **Query** type activities. This functionality lets you enrich the data targeted by the query and transfer this data to the following workflow activities where it can be exploited. After having added additional data, you can apply an additional filter level to the initially targeted data by creating conditions based on the defined additional data. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/query.md#enriching-data).  |
|  Contextual help  | A contextual help function is now available across the different Adobe Campaign screens. This means that, in a single click, you can directly access the documentation on the functionality that you are currently using. To display contextual help, click the '?' icon in the upper-right corner of the screen, as shown in the example below.  ![](assets/contextual_help.png)
