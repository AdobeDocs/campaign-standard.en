## Improvements

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Enhanced Image edition capabilities with the Creative SDK  | You now have access to a complete set of features powered by the Creative SDK to enhance your images directly in the content editor when editing emails or landing pages. This feature does not require the acquisition of additional Creative Cloud solutions. For more information, refer to the .  |
|  Transactional push notifications  | The Mobile application channel has been added to Adobe Campaign's transactional messaging capabilities. Three channels are now supported for transactional messages: email, SMS and push notifications. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/transactional-push-notifications.md).  |
|  Recurring push notifications  | You can now configure recurring push notifications in a workflow. You can use recurring push notifications in situations where your customers expect periodic updates like weekly reminders to check out new content or promotions. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/mobile-app-delivery.md).  |
|  Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) connector  | The Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) connector can now be used to import or export data to Adobe Campaign. It can be set up in a workflow activity. The configuration is done in an external account. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../administration/using/external-accounts.md).  |
|  Dreamweaver integration live  | The integration between Adobe Campaign and Dreamweaver is now live. It now works with the official last released version of Dreamweaver (17.0.2). This requires the installation of Adobe Campaign Integration extension from here: [http://adobe.ly/acdw_addon](http://adobe.ly/acdw_addon) For more information, refer to this [video](http://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/en/Videos/ACS_Dreamweaver.mp4).  |

## Patches

### Emails and SMS messages
