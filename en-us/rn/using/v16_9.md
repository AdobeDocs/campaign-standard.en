# v16.9

09/19/2016

## <p>Improvements</p>

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Remarketing Triggers  | Integration between the core service **Triggers** and Adobe Campaign allows you to send personalized emails to your customers as a reaction to specific behaviors that are tracked on your website by Adobe Analytics (within 15 minutes). In Adobe Marketing Cloud, you define the different triggers, that is to say, the customer behaviors that you would like to monitor, such as all of the clients who abandoned their cart or their form, removed a product from their cart, or even the clients whose session expired. When creating a trigger, you define the trigger's condition and the data that will be sent in the event (pload) to Adobe Campaign. In Adobe Campaign, you select the trigger that was previously created, you enrich the event data with datamart data and you define a transactional message template linked to that trigger. For example, when a client abandons their cart, an event is sent to Adobe Campaign which can then leverage this event via a remarketing email that is sent to the client within 15 minutes. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrating/using/about-marketing-cloud-triggers.md).  |
|  Transactional messages: Pause / Unpublish  | You can now suspend the publication of a transactional template while you update its content. The corresponding messages are no longer sent, but they are stored in the database. When resuming, the queued messages are processed and they are sent if they have not expired. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/event-transactional-messages.md#suspending-a-transactional-message-publication). You can now also unpublish events and transactional templates. The corresponding messages are not sent anymore and they are not stored in the database. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/event-transactional-messages.md#unpublishing-a-transactional-message).  |
|  Multibranding  | Clients with multiple brands can now manage them in the same instance. Branding is a feature managed by the administrator of your Adobe Campaign instance that allows you to centrally configure all of the parameters related to a brand within Adobe Campaign. This includes things such as the logo to more technical parameters like tracking URLs, Web Analytics, server URL, domain name, etc. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../administration/using/branding.md).  |
|  Responsive email design preview  | This feature allows you to test your email's responsiveness on different types of devices. In the email preview, a grid has been added to test your email on various screen sizes.  |
|  Push notifications  | A new channel has been added to allow marketers to send personalized and segmented push notifications on iOS and Android mobile devices. Messages can be sent through a single delivery or using a workflow activity. Compatibility with Transactional messaging will be available in future versions. This channel leverages the Mobile core serviceâ€™s SDK (available [here](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/gallery/marketing-cloud-mobile-libraries )). For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/about-push-notifications.md).  |

### <p>Transactional messages</p>

* A prefix is now automatically added to the identifier of a new event definition.
* The icon representing the transactional messages in the interface has been changed.

### <p>Integrations</p>
