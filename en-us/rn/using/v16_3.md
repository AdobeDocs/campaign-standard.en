# v16.3

04/19/2016

## <p>Improvements</p>

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Interface and navigation  | The Adobe Campaign interface was improved to make navigation and operations simple and intuitive. You now navigate from the top bar of the application. The advanced menus are accessible by selecting the **Adobe Campaign** logo. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../start/using/interface-description.md).  |
|  Workflows: Save audience  | A new option, **Create then update an audience**, is now available in the **Save audience** activity. This option allows you to manually enter an audience label. If the label entered corresponds to an existing audience, it will be updated. If the audience does not exist, it will be created. In addition, the audience will be updated every time the workflow is executed (again). You can always select the audience update mode: complete the audience with new data or replace the whole of the audience data at every execution. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/save-audience.md).  |
|  Workflows: Segmentation  | The **Segmentation** activity now allows the user to segment the data of a temporary resource. For example: the data of an imported file. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/segmentation.md).  |

## <p>Patches</p>

### <p>General</p>

* Fixed a display error that occurred when sorting a list: the arrow indicating the sort order of a column could only be inversed for certain types of data.
* Fixed an error that limited the number of elements displayed in a drop-down menu when a rule was added in a query.

### <p>Emails and SMS messages</p>

* Fixed an error that could prevent access to the email rendering report.
* The prepare send stage for a message now returns an error if the sender address is not provided.

### <p>Workflows</p>

* Certain file formatting options were visible but not taken into account when a CSV format file was extracted. These options are now no longer visible.
* Fixed an error caused when the **Delete the source files after transfer** option was checked for a **SFTP** type file transfer.
* Fixed an error that could prevent the counter and preview of **Query** data from being displayed after refreshing the page.
* Fixed an error caused by opening certain transitions in a workflow, particularly after a delivery activity or a query in which the targeting and filtering dimensions were different.
* Fixed an error that prevented a personalization field from being inserted into a delivery activity of a workflow if the workflow was not saved after adding the activity.
* Fixed an error that prevented the outbound transition targeting dimension of an email delivery activity from being displayed.

### <p>Landing pages</p>

* Fixed an error that prevented the personalization fields from functioning correctly in a localizable content block in a landing page.

### <p>Custom resources</p>

* Fixed an error that prevented a search on a custom resource from being carried out if the **Add search fields** option of the resource screen definition was checked and if several fields were selected in the **Filter zone composition**.
