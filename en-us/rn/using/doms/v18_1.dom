     <td>Reporting for Fatigue Management<br /> </td> 
     <td><p>Reporting for Fatigue Management is a dedicated, configurable report displaying the impact fatigue rules have on deliveries across the Email, Push, SMS, and Direct Mail channels within a specified date range before send. With the added insight of being able to quickly see all conflicting campaigns in a single view, marketers are able to plan marketing campaigns according to set the fatigue rules more effectively, and prioritize communications.</p> <p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../../administration/using/working-with-typology-rules.md#viewing-the-fatigue-rule-summary-report">detailed documentation</a>.</p> </td>

Users who receive recurring reports have the ability to unsubscribe from these communications via a dedicated link in each email.</p> <p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../../reporting/using/reporting-interface.md#share-tab">detailed documentation</a>.</p> </td>

     <td><p>Push Message Preview - Preview push notifications on iOS and Android devices from within the push notification content editor to see exactly what your recipients will see before testing or executing the delivery. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../channels/using/creating-and-sending-a-push-notification.md#previewing-the-notification">detailed documentation</a>.</p> <p>Content Available - When apps are not opened over longer periods of time, their data can become outdated. This results in the data having to be updated or replaced at the moment a user finally opens the app, which can cause delays in using the app. With the added support of Content Available, Adobe Campaign users can wake up their app to refresh its data in the background when delivering a push notification, enabling greater consistency and control over a user’s in-app experience.</p> <p>Mutable Content - With the added support of Mutable Content, Adobe Campaign users can now leverage their mobile app extensions to further modify the content or presentation of arriving push notifications sent from Adobe Campaign. For example, users can leverage Mutable Content to:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>decrypt data that was delivered in an encrypted format</li> 
       <li>download images or other media files and add them as attachments to a notification</li> 
       <li>change the body or title text of a notification</li> 
       <li>add a thread identifier to a notification</li> 
      </ul> <p>For more information on Content Available and Mutable Content, refer to the <a href="../../channels/using/customizing-a-push-notification.md#change-the-notification-behaviour-for-ios">detailed documentation</a>.</p> <p><strong>Warning</strong>: These updates on push notifications require customers to upgrade their mobile applications.
