    <tr> 
     <td> Enriched transactional messages </td> 
     <td> You can now link transactional templates with the Adobe Campaign database to recover information that allows you to enrich the content of your transactional messages. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../administration/using/transactional-messaging-configuration.md#enriching-the-transactional-message-content">detailed documentation</a>. </td>

    <tr> 
     <td> Dynamic URLs for images </td> 
     <td> This new functionality allows you to personalize an image source by inserting content blocks and dynamic text for tracking and personalization purposes. It then becomes possible, amongst other things, to profit from the functionalities of AEM Asset (S7) dynamic media by entering parameters into the image URLs. For example, you can send an email with personalized images stating "Hello Alexandre, get the latest news about upcoming events in Paris!" or "Hello Frank, get the latest news about upcoming events in New York!". For more information, refer to the . </td>

    <tr> 
     <td> Integration with People Core Service </td> 
     <td> The Adobe Marketing Cloud <strong>Declared IDs</strong> are now covered by the integration between Adobe Campaign and People Core Service (Profiles &amp; Audiences). This means that you can import segments and export audiences made up of <strong>Visitor ID</strong>s or <strong>Declared ID</strong>s. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../integrating/using/about-people-core-service-integration.md">detailed documentation</a>. </td>

    <tr> 
     <td> Delivery logs </td> 
     <td> The MTA logs (delivery server) now display the complete history of each message, particularly all of the delivery attempts as well as the associated error statuses, and this has no impact on the application's performance. </td>

  <h2>Patches</h2>
  <h3>General</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><p>Fixed an error that could cause irrelevant fields to be displayed instead of fields that need to be completed. This would happen after the comparison operator was modified multiple times when editing a condition in a query.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Fixed the behavior of the option <strong>The last X days/months/quarters/years</strong> when defining a relative filtering condition for a date field. The period calculated is now a sliding period relative to the date and time of the server and not calendar-based.</p> </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Workflows</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><p>Fixed an error that would return an incorrect list of values in the screen for selecting the targeting dimension in the properties of a <strong>Query</strong> activity.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Fixed an error that would force the <strong>Exists</strong> operator to be selected when adding an average or count aggregate on a collection element in a <strong>Query</strong> activity.</p> </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Content editing</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><p>Fixed an error that could lead to display problems (responsive design) when importing HTML content: the style attributes are no longer rewritten when the content is opened for the first time after being imported.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Fixed a non-blocking error that was caused when a condition was added on a dynamic content variant.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Fixed an error caused by adding a checkbox in the content of a landing page. The checkbox was unusable.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Fixed an error that could occur when deleting text in a block if the cursor was placed at the start of the block in question.</p> </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Transactional messages</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><p>When integrating a website, you can now define an expiration date for any given event. Once this date has been passed, the message corresponding to the event can no longer be sent.</p> </li>
  </ul>
