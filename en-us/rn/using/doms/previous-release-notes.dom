When creating a trigger, you define the trigger's condition and the data that will be sent in the event (pload) to Adobe Campaign. <br /> In Adobe Campaign, you select the trigger that was previously created, you enrich the event data with datamart data and you define a transactional message template linked to that trigger. For example, when a client abandons their cart, an event is sent to Adobe Campaign which can then leverage this event via a remarketing email that is sent to the client within 15 minutes.<br /> For more information, refer to the <a href="../../integrating/using/about-adobe-experience-cloud-triggers.md">detailed documentation</a>.<br /> </td>
