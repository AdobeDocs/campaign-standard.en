For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../reporting/using/about-dynamic-reports.md).  |
|  Mass Subscription with Origin & Date  | With this Mass Subscription enhancement, you are now able to store subscription information (origin and date) directly in the Adobe Campaign Standard database through the Subscription Services activity in a workflow. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/subscription-services.md).  |

## <p>Patches</p>

### <p>Platform</p>

* Some customers need to be able to leverage an ID coming from Adobe Campaign Standard as they don't manage a unique key to identify their own records. This ID (**ACS ID**) can be exported as well as used as a reconciliation key while updating the data. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../developing/using/generating-a-unique-id-for-profiles-and-custom-resources.md).
* The FTP protocol is being deprecated. You should now use SFTP instead. In order to not block existing implementations, existing configurations on FTP will still work as before but the option will not be showing for new activities.

### <p>Emails, SMS messages and direct mail</p>

* It is now possible to create new alerting criteria to use them in delivery alerting notifications. For more information, refer to the .
* The delivery alerting notifications have a new design and the delivery alerting dashboard user experience has been improved.
* Now when a routing external account is disabled, a warning is displayed in the impacted deliveries (email, SMS and push) and the **Preview** button is hidden in these deliveries.
* Fixed an issue that caused an error in the preview of an A/B test on the email content when dynamic text was enabled in the subject line.

### <p>Transactional messages</p>

* It is now possible to define when you want to send a follow-up message, for example 3 days after a transactional message was sent. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/follow-up-messages.md#sending-a-follow-up-message).
* It is now possible to define the date from when the transactional messages linked to an event should be sent.
* Fixed an issue that caused an SQL error when executing a workflow containing a follow-up message after deleting profiles linked to received and processed events.
* Fixed an error that prevented to delete a profile linked to an event.
* Fixed an issue that could prevent the redirection of tracked links from working.
* Fixed an issue which prevented you from disable tracking for certain links in an email or SMS message.

### <p>Reports</p>

* The **Hot clicks** report has been improved. Also, it is now possible to display hot clicks according to each conditional content that was defined in a delivery and to display hot clicks for each execution of recurring deliveries or transactional messages. For more information, refer to the .
* Fixed an issue which prevented the quarantine metric from retrieving correct data.
* A new preset time frame has been added to the calendar widget.
* The [dynamic report metrics](../../reporting/using/indicator-calculation.md) and the [campaigns' KPIs](../../sending/using/confirming-send.md) (displayed on the dashboard of sent messages) have been aligned for more coherence.
* Fixed an issue that could cause pipelined to crash on debian 7.

### <p>Workflows</p>

* Fixed an issue that could prevent the imported file retention from working.

### <p>Integrations</p>

* evars and events are now supported for the Analytics & Campaign integration.
* When sending an email with the content of the abandoned cart, the payload parameter for elements removed from cart is now optional.

### <p>Profiles and audiences</p>

* Adobe Campaign now provides a report that displays the number of active profiles. This report is only informative, it doesn't have a direct impact on billing. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../audiences/using/active-profiles.md).
* Fixed an issue that prevented profiles from being subscribed to a service when using the Profiles and Services API.
