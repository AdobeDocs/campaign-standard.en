# v15.4

04/27/2015

## <p>Improvements</p>

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Package exports / Package imports  | The **Deployment** menu now allows users with admin rights to exchange resources between different Adobe Campaign instances by exporting and importing packages. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/managing-packages.md).  |
|  Reports  | All reports (except the **Hot clicks** report) can now be accessed from a program. These reports are: These reports can be filtered over a given period (e.g. three months, six months, etc.). The campaign reports can also be filtered. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../reporting/using/about-dynamic-reports.md).  |
|  Workflows: **Email delivery** activity  | The **Email delivery** activity in the workflows has been improved. You can now find emails, recurring emails, and detailed information regarding recurring email executions from the list of application marketing activities. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/email-delivery.md).  |
|  Workflows: **Segmentation** activity  | The **Segmentation** activity is now available in the workflows. This activity allows you to create one or several segments and link a segment code to them from a population computed by activities placed upstream in the same workflow. From this activity, the segments can be processed in one single transition or in different multiple transitions. There are now options to filter the population and limit the size of each segment to optimize personalization. For example, you can randomly select profiles that correspond to specific criteria. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/segmentation.md).  |
|  Integrations: **Assets Core Service** | You can now use shared resources via **Assets Core Service** in your email and landing page contents. You can manage your shared resources directly from Adobe Marketing Cloud. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrating/using/assets-core-service-integration.md).  |
|  Integrations: **Adobe Target** | You can now insert images that are dynamically computed by **Adobe Target** into your Adobe Campaign emails. This allows you to offer several versions of the same email by personalizing the content according to the criteria defined in Adobe Target segments. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrating/using/about-adobe-target-integration.md).  |
|  Digital Content Editor: **Block selector** | When a block is selected in the HTML content editor, a breadcrumb is displayed at the bottom of the editing zone. This allows you to easily navigate to and select different elements. Refer to the [detailed documentation](../../designing/using/managing-blocks.md).  |
