## <p>Patches</p>

### <p>General</p>

* The **Access authorization** options have returned to the landing page properties.
* Fixed an issue that may have caused an old image to be rendered instead of the correct image. This occurred if the source image had been updated in the content definition of a delivery or landing page.
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from editing certain fields in an existing SFTP external account.
* Fixed several UI issues. For example, users can now edit profile attributes and save modifications without experiencing problems with the UI.

* Fixed an issue that may have caused an extra escaping character to be added to Unicode characters used for Emojis.
* When a subscriber's registration token becomes blacklisted, the corresponding status is now immediately updated in the application's list of subscribers in Adobe Campaign.

### <p>Workflows</p>

* Fixed an issue that may have prevented previews of queries on event resources (e.g. rtEvent).
* The reject file generated by a **Load file** activity can now be retrieved in its outbound transition and processed in the next activity. For example, upload the reject file via an SFTP server using **Transfer file**.
* Fixed an issue that may have prevented a user from limiting the population of a segment if **Temporary resource** was selected in the **General** tab of **Segmentation**.
* **Scheduler** activities can no longer be set to trigger a workflow more than once every 10 minutes.
* Fixed an issue that may have prevented **Use common columns** from working properly in an **Union** activity.

### <p>Integrations</p>

* Fixed an issue that may have caused the technical workflow to clear the Target Dimension field when importing audiences from People core service. Subsequent queries could not retrieve the imported audiences.
* Fixed an issue that may have caused the **Save audience** activity of a workflow to fail when the option **Share in Adobe Marketing Cloud** was checked.
