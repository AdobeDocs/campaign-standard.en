# v15.7

08/07/2015

## Improvements

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Exporting lists  | You can now export content from your lists into a file in CSV format. This function is available in all screens with a **List** mode (for example: profile list). The data exported is the data in the columns displayed when exporting. By editing the list, you can therefore select the data that you would like to export. For more information on using this functionality, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/exporting-lists.md).  |
|  Integration with Adobe Profiles & Audiences  | You can now share audiences between Adobe Campaign and your other Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions: For more information on configuring and using this functionality, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrating/using/about-people-core-service-integration.md).  |
|  Digital Content Editor - Dynamic content  | The dynamic content interface has been improved. Arrows now appear to allow you to navigate between the different dynamic contents, directly in the email body. For more information on using this functionality, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../designing/using/defining-dynamic-content.md).  |
|  Digital Content Editor - Dynamic text  | From the content editor of an email, you can now define dynamic text: For more information on using this functionality, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../designing/using/defining-dynamic-text.md).  |
|  Programs and campaigns - Reports  | The interface and graphics of the reports have been improved. For more information on using this functionality, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../reporting/using/defining-the-report-period.md).  |
