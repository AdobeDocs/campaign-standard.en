# v16.2

03/21/2016

## <p>Improvements</p>

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  A/B test for emails  | You can now carry out A/B tests on the content, subject, or sender name of your emails. This new functionality can test up to three variants of an element. When creating an email from one of the new templates specific to A/B tests, a new step in the creation wizard allows you to define the parameters of your test. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/creating-an-a-b-test.md).  |
|  Brand management  | You can now define one or several brands to centrally enter the parameters that affect a brand's identity. Adobe Campaign allows you to create these brands and link them to delivery or landing page templates. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../administration/using/branding.md#assigning-a-brand-to-an-email).  |
|  Workflows: Incremental query  | A new workflow activity, **Incremental query**, allows you to carry out a query which, on every execution, targets only the new results. The results of previous executions are automatically excluded. Linked to a **Scheduler** activity, you can define the execution frequency of the **Incremental query**. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/incremental-query.md).  |
|  Transactional messages  | The user friendliness of the transactional messages interface has been improved. All business process management linked to transactional messages is currently centralized in the **Marketing plans** > **Transactional messages** menu. Event configuration has also been improved. Events are now managed independently from custom resources. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/about-transactional-messaging.md).  |
