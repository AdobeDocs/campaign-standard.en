# Inserting tracking links

Inserting tracking links

The content editor allows you to personalize your email by inserting links into the HTML content elements.

The following types of links are available:

* Link to an external URL
* Link to a landing page
* Subscription link
* Unsubscription link

>[!NOTE]
>
>The creation and configuration of these links are detailed in the [Adding a link](../../designing/using/adding-a-link.md) section.

The **Tracked URLs** icon in the action bar automatically displays the list of all the URLs included in the content.

Tracking is activated by default.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This functionality is only available if tracking has been activated in Adobe Campaign.

The list of tracked URLs is divided into two zones:

* HTML, for the tracked URLs in the HTML content.
* Text, for the tracked URLs in the text content.

The label and the category of each URL can be modified directly from the list.

For each tracked URL you can activate or deactivate tracking.

>The URLs are detected by Adobe Campaign if they start with: "&lt;%@" "&lt;!--" "[protocol]://"

You can regroup your URLs by editing the **Category** field, depending on the URLs used in the delivery.
