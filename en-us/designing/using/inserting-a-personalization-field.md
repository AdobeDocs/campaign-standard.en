# Inserting a personalization field

Inserting a personalization field

Adobe Campaign allows you to insert a field from the database into your page such as the recipient's first name.

To add a personalization field to the content:

1. Click inside a text block and select **Insert personalization field** from the contextual toolbar.
1. Select the field that you would like to insert into your page content.

The field name appears in the editor and it is highlighted.

Once personalization is generated (when previewing and preparing the email for example), this field will be replaced by the value corresponding to the targeted recipient.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the email is created from a workflow, the additional data computed in the workflow is also available in the personalization fields. For more information about adding additional data from a workflow, refer to the [Enriching data](../../automating/using/targeting-data.md#enriching-data) section.
