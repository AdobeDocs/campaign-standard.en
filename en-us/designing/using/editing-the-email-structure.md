# Editing the email structure

Editing the email structure

The Creative Designer allows you to easily define the structure of your email. By adding and moving structural elements with simple drag & drop actions, you can design the shape of your email within seconds.

1. Open an existing content or create a new email content.
1. Access the **Structure components** by selecting the **+** icon on the left.
1. Drag and drop the structure components you need to shape your email.

   A blue line materializes the exact location of the structure components before you drop it. You can drop it above, between or below any other component, but not inside.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Once placed in the email, you cannot move nor remove your components unless there is already a content/fragment placed inside.

Once the structure is defined, you are able to add content fragments and components to your email, as explained in [this section](../../designing/using/adding-fragments-and-content-components.md).
