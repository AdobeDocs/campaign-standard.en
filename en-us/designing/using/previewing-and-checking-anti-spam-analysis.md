# Previewing and checking anti-spam analysis

Previewing and checking anti-spam analysis

Once the content of your email is ready, you can preview it. The preview mode offers different views of the email: web and mobile versions.

To perform and inbox rendering using Litmus, refer to [this document](../../sending/using/email-rendering.md).

1. Select **Preview** to access the preview mode of the content.
1. When the preview mode opens, your message is analyzed by the anti-spam checker. If your message has a high spam score, a warning is displayed.

   Select **Anti-spam** analysis to open the details of the scoring and check what you should modify to enhance your message.

   Dynamic content fragments are highlighted in orange.

1. To exit the **Preview** mode, select **Edit** in the top bar of the editor.
