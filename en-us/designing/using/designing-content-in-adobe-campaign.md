# Designing content in Adobe Campaign

Designing content in Adobe Campaign

Once you have created a delivery or a landing page in Adobe Campaign, you need to define its content.

* For more on editing email content and using the content editors provided by Adobe Campaign, see [About email content design](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md).
* For more on editing landing page content, see [About landing page content design](../../designing/using/about-landing-page-content-design.md).
* For more on editing SMS or push notification content, see [About SMS and push content design](../../designing/using/about-sms-and-push-content-design.md).

When creating an email or a landing page, you can choose to use a predefined template or to load an existing content from another source. See [Selecting an existing content](../../designing/using/selecting-an-existing-content.md).

To increase the efficiency of your marketing campaigns, personalize your content. See [Inserting a personalization field](../../designing/using/inserting-a-personalization-field.md) and [Adding a content block](../../designing/using/adding-a-content-block.md).

You can also define dynamic content that varies depending on each recipient. See [Defining dynamic content in an email](../../designing/using/defining-dynamic-content-in-an-email.md) and [Defining dynamic content in a landing page](../../designing/using/defining-dynamic-content-in-a-landing-page.md).

Enhance your deliveries and landing pages with links and images. See [Inserting a link](../../designing/using/inserting-a-link.md) and [Inserting images](../../designing/using/inserting-images.md).
