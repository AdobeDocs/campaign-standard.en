# About targeting activities

About targeting activities

From the palette, on the left-hand side of the screen, unfold the **Targeting** section.

These activities are specific to targeting, manipulating population data, and filtering activities. They let you build one or more targets by defining sets and splitting or combining these sets using intersection, union, or exclusion operations.
