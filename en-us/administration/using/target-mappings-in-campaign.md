# Target mappings in Campaign

Target mappings in Campaign

Target mappings are technical objects used by Campaign in order to deliver messages. They contain all the technical settings required to send deliveries (addresses, phone numbers, blacklist indicators, additional identifiers...).

Administrators can access target mappings in the **Administration > Application settings > Target mappings** menu.

Target mapping creation or modification is possible to cover specific needs. In any case, their targeting dimension should always correspond to profiles (**nms:recipient** table). For more on targeting dimensions, refer to [this page](../../automating/using/query.md#targeting-dimensions-and-resources).
