# About Adobe Analytics integration

About Adobe Analytics integration

Thanks to Adobe Analytics integration in Adobe Campaign, you can now track the success of your email deliveries directly in Adobe Analytics.

This integration between Adobe Campaign Standard and Adobe Analytics will allow you to:

* Share your KPI (Key Performance Indicator) data from Adobe Campaign Standard to Adobe Analytics.
* Enrich tracking formulas with Adobe Analytics parameters.

This will work by first creating an external account linked to Adobe Analytics. A technical workflow will then automatically launch and will, by default, auto-executes every 15 minutes. Your KPI data are then pushed to Analytics.

This integration is available for email deliveries only.

An integration between Adobe Analytics' core service **Triggers** and Adobe Campaign is also available. It allows you to send personalized emails to your customers as a reaction to specific behaviors that are tracked on your website by Adobe Analytics (within 15 minutes).
