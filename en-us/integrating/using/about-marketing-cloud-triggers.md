# About Marketing Cloud Triggers

About Marketing Cloud Triggers

Integration between the Marketing Cloud Activation core service **Triggers** and Adobe Campaign allows you to send personalized emails to your customers as a reaction to specific behaviors that are tracked on your website by Adobe Analytics (within 15 minutes).

In Adobe Marketing Cloud, you define the different triggers, that is to say, the customer behaviors that you would like to monitor, such as all of the clients who abandoned their cart or their form, removed a product from their cart, or even the clients whose session expired. When creating a trigger, you define the trigger's condition and the data that will be sent in the event (pload) to Adobe Campaign.

In Adobe Campaign, you select the trigger that was previously created, you enrich the event data with datamart data and you define a transactional message template linked to that trigger. For example, when a client abandons their cart, an event is sent to Adobe Campaign which can then leverage this event via a remarketing email that is sent to the client within 15 minutes.

This documentation includes two [Use cases](../../integrating/using/use-cases.md).

For more information on how to use Marketing Cloud Triggers, refer to the [Trigger Remarketing Messages based on Site Activity](https://helpx.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/how-to/email-marketing.html) video.
