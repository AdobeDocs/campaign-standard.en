# Integrating with Adobe Marketing Cloud

Integrating with Adobe Marketing Cloud

Integration with other Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions may require you to adapt your initial configuration. Contact your Adobe technical administrator for more information.

If you have other Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, you can integrate them with Adobe Campaign, and then you will be able to:

* Use contents created from Adobe Experience Manager in Adobe Campaign messages.

  For more on this, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager](../../integrating/using/creating-campaigns-and-emails-in-experience-manager-6_3.md) section in the Integrations guide.

* Import shared audiences from different Marketing Cloud solutions in order to use them in Adobe Campaign, and export Adobe Campaign audiences into Adobe Marketing Cloud, so that they can be used in different solutions.

  For more on this, refer to the [People Core Service](../../integrating/using/about-people-core-service-integration.md) section in the Integrations guide.

* Insert dynamic images generated by Adobe Target into your Adobe Campaign messages.

  For more on this, refer to the [Adobe Target](../../integrating/using/about-adobe-target-integration.md) section in the Integrations guide.

* Use resources shared from Adobe Marketing Cloud in your Adobe Campaign messages and landing pages.

  For more on this, refer to the [Assets Core Service](../../integrating/using/assets-core-service-integration.md) section in the Integrations guide.

* Track the success of your email deliveries directly in Adobe Analytics.

  For more on this, refer to the [Adobe Analytics](../../integrating/using/about-adobe-analytics-integration.md) section in the Integrations guide.

* Through integration with Adobe Analytics for mobile, use the Points of Interest data collected from your mobile application's subscribers to send them personalized marketing messages.

  For more on this, refer to the [Points of Interest data](../../integrating/using/about-points-of-interest-data.md) section in the Integrations guide.

* Create and modify the content of your emails in Dreamweaver.

  For more on this refer to the [Editing content in Dreamweaver](../../designing/using/design-content-in-adobe-campaign.md#editing-content-in-dreamweaver) section.
