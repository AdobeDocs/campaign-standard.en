# Discovering workflows

Discovering workflows

Adobe Campaign offers a comprehensive **graphical environment** that allows you to design **complete processes** including segmentation, campaign execution, file processing, approvals, etc.

For example, you can use a workflow to download a file from a server, decompress it, and then import its records into the Adobe Campaign database.

A workflow can also involve users by assigning them tasks or having them approve performed tasks. This means you can assign a task to one or several users to work on content or specify targets, and approve proofs before sending the message.

Workflows can be used in **different contexts**, as for example:

* Targeting to manage audiences or send messages
* Importing data into the database
* Technical processes: database cleanup, recovering tracking information, etc.
* Data management: data manipulation
