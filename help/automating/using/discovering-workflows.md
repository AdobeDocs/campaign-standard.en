# Discovering workflows{#discovering-workflows}

Adobe Campaign offers a comprehensive [graphical environment](../../automating/using/workflow-interface.md) that allows you to design [complex processes](../../automating/using/workflow-operating-principles.md) including segmentation, campaign execution, file processing, approvals, etc. Principles and best practices are described in [this section](../../automating/using/building-a-workflow.md).

For example, you can use a workflow to download a file from a server, decompress it, and then import its records into the Adobe Campaign database.

A workflow can also involve users by assigning them tasks or having them approve performed tasks. This means you can assign a task to one or several users to work on content or specify targets, and approve proofs before sending the message.

Workflows can be used in **different contexts**, as for example:

* Targeting to manage audiences or send messages. For more on this, refer to [Channel activities](../../automating/using/about-channel-activities.md) and [Targeting activities](../../automating/using/about-targeting-activities.md).
* Data management (ETL) to manipulate data. For more on this, refer to [Data management activities](../../automating/using/about-data-management-activities.md).
* Importing data into Campaign database. For more on this, refer to [Importing and exporting data](../../automating/using/about-data-import-and-export.md).
* Technical processes such as database cleanup, recovering tracking information, etc. Learn more about technical workflows in [this section](../../administration/using/technical-workflows.md).

Workflows are also accessible from the Adobe Campaign Standard API. For more on this, refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/en/api/ACS_API.html#managing-workflows) .
