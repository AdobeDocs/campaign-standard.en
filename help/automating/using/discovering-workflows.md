With Adobe Campaign, you can import, transform, filter, manage, and export data to design and automate your business processes.

## About workflows {#about-workflows}

<img src="assets/do-not-localize/icon_workflows.svg" width="60px">

Adobe Campaign offers a comprehensive graphical environment that allows you to **design and automate complex processes** from one single interface. Processes can include segmentation, campaign execution, file processing, approvals, delivery sending etc.

## Workflow activities {#workflow-activities}

<img src="assets/do-not-localize/icon_activities.svg" width="60px">

Various activities are available to help you design your workflows. 

**Targeting activities** allow you to build one or more targets by defining sets and splitting or combining these sets using intersection, union, or exclusion operations.

With **Execution activities**, coordinate your workflow and its activities, while **Channel activities** let you combine Campaign Standard communication channels to create cross-channel workflows.

Finally, **Data management activities** allow you to manipulate data from your database.

## Filter data {#filter-data}

<img src="assets/do-not-localize/icon_filter.svg" width="60px">

Leverage the **query editor** to filter data from your database and build a population to better target your recipients. The query editor is available to perform several actions in Campaign Standard: create Query type audiences, define delivery targets, or populations in workflow activities.

The query editor comes with **predefined filters and rules** for quick and easy filtering. However, you can also use **advanced expression editing** capabilities. This allows you to manually enter conditions and use functions, in order to form your own rules.

## Import/export data {#import-export-data}

<img src="assets/do-not-localize/icon_manage.svg" width="60px">

Campaign Standard comes with several **data management capabilities** to import and export data.

[Workflows data management activities](../../automating/using/about-data-management-activities.md) allow you to import data, perform mass updates on fields, receive or send file, or link unidentified data to existing resources.

With [Import templates](../../automating/using/importing-data-with-import-templates.md), manage certain types of import defined by administrators through simplified import functions.

[Exporting logs](../../automating/using/exporting-logs.md) let you export log data through a simple workflow, allowing you to analyse the resultats of your marketing campaigns in your own reporting or BI tools.

Leverage [Packages](../../automating/using/managing-packages.md) to exchange resources between different campaign instances, for example, to replicate the configuation of an instance, or to transfer data from a server to another including custom resources.

Finally, [Exporting lists](../../automating/using/exporting-lists.md) allow you to export any list from Campaign Standard like, for example, the list of test profiles, the list of quarantines email addresses, etc.
