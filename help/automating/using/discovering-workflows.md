## About workflows {#about-workflows}

Adobe Campaign offers a comprehensive graphical environment that allows you to design and automate complex processes from one single interface. Processes can include segmentation, campaign execution, file processing, approvals, delivery sending etc.

Various activities are available to help you design your workflows:

* **[Targeting activities](../../automating/using/about-targeting-activities.md)**: Build one or more targets by defining sets and splitting or combining these sets using intersection, union, or exclusion operations. 
* **[Execution activities](../../automating/using/about-execution-activities.md)**: Coordinate your workflow and its activities.
* **[Channel activities](../../automating/using/about-channel-activities.md)**: Use and combine Campaign Standard communication channels to create cross-channel workflows.
* **[Data management activities](../../automating/using/about-data-management-activities.md)**: Manipulate data from your database.

* [Executing a workflow](../../automating/using/executing-a-workflow.md)
* [Workflow best practices](../../automating/using/best-practices-workflows.md)
* [Workflows use cases](../../automating/using/workflow-created-query-with-complement.md)

## Filter data {#filter-data}

Leverage the **query editor** to filter data from your database and build a population to better target your recipients. The query editor is available to perform several actions in Campaign Standard: create Query type audiences, define delivery targets, or populations in workflow activities.

The query editor comes with predefined filters and rules for quick and easy filtering. However, you can also use **advanced expression editing** capabilities. This allows you to manually enter conditions and use functions, in order to form your own rules.

## Import/export data {#import-export-data}

Campaign Standard comes with several data management capabilities to import and export data.

* **[Workflows data management activities](../../automating/using/about-data-management-activities.md)**: import data, perform mass updates on fields, receive or send file, or link unidentified data to existing resources.
* **[Import templates](../../automating/using/importing-data-with-import-templates.md)**: manage certain types of import defined by administrators through simplified import functions.
* **[Exporting logs](../../automating/using/exporting-logs.md)**: export log data through a simple workflow, allowing you to analyse the resultats of your marketing campaigns in your own reporting or BI tools.
* **[Packages](../../automating/using/managing-packages.md)**: Exchange resources between different campaign instances, for example, to replicate the configuation of an instance, or to transfer data from a server to another including custom resources.
* **[Exporting lists](../../automating/using/exporting-lists.md)**: exports any list from Campaign Standard like, for example, the list of test profiles, the list of quarantines email addresses, etc.
