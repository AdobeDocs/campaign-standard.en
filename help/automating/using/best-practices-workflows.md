# Workflow best practices

## Naming

To ease workflow troubleshooting, Adobe recommends to name and label your workflows explicitly. Fill in the workflow's description field to summarize the process to be performed so that the operator can easily understand it.
If the workflow is part of a process involving multiple workflows, you can use numbers when entering a label to order them clearly.

For example:

* 001 – Import - Import recipients
* 002 – Import – Import sales
* 003 – Import – Import sales details
* 010 – Export – Export delivery logs
* 011 – Export – Export tracking logs

## Duplicating workflows

You can duplicate workflows. In the **[!UICONTROL Marketing Activities]**, hover over the workflow and click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate element]**.

## Execution

Adobe recommends not to run more than 20 workflows simultaneously. Depending on the nature of activities in your workflow, when executing too many workflows at the same time, the system can run out of resources and become unstable.

A workflow cannot be automatically executed more often than once every ten minutes.
The Repetition frequency of the activity cannot be less than 10 minutes. If the repetition frequency is set at 0 (also the default value), this option is not taken into account and the workflow will run according to the execution frequency specified.

A workflow containing unterminated transitions can still be executed: it will generate a warning message and the workflow will pause once it reaches the transition but will not generate an error. You can also start a workflow without a finished design and complete it as you go along.

For more information, refer to [Executing workflows](../../automating/using//executing-a-workflow.md).

## Activity

To ensure that the workflow ends properly, use an **[!UICONTROL End activity]**. Avoid leaving the last transition of a workflow on its own.

To access the detail view of the transitions, check the **[!UICONTROL Keep interim results]** option in the Execution section of the workflow properties.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>This option consumes a lot of memory and is designed to help constructing a workflow and ensure it is correctly configured and behaving. Leave it unchecked on production instances.

### Naming of the activity

While developing your workflow, a name is generated for every activity, as for all Adobe Campaign objects. While the name is generated by the tool, we recommend to rename it with an explicit name when configuring it. By doing it later, you may interrupt the workflow because of activities using the former name of the activity. Updating names afterwards would represent a heavy task.

### Duplicating activities

To duplicate existing activities, you can use copy-paste. This way, you keep the settings that were originally defined. For more information, refer to [Duplicating workflow activities](../../automating/using/workflow-interface.md).

Each marketing activity offers several types by default. You can preconfigure certain parameters according to your needs. For more information, refer to the [Managing templates section](../automating/using/building-a-workflow.md#configuring).

### Scheduler activity

When building your workflow, only use one **[!UICONTROL Scheduler activity]** per branch. If the same branch of a workflow has several schedulers (linked to each other), the number of tasks to be executed will be multiplied exponentially, which would considerably overload the database.

You can preview the next ten executions of your workflows by clicking **[!UICONTROL Preview next executions]**.

For more information, refer to [Scheduler activity](../../automating/using/scheduler.md).

## Targeting dimension

The targeting dimension can be defined when creating an audience. For more information, see [Creating audiences](../../automating/using/creating-audiences.md).

## External Signal - Call workflow with parameters

Make sure that the name and number of parameters are identical to what is defined when calling the workflow (see [Defining the parameters when calling the workflow](../../automating/using/calling-a-workflow-with-external-parameters.md#defining-the-parameters-when-calling-the-workflow)). The parameters' types must also be consistent with the values that are expected.

Make sure that all the parameters have been declared in the **[!UICONTROL External signal activity]**. Otherwise, an error will occur when running the activity.

For more information, see [Calling a workflow with external parameters](../../automating/using/calling-a-workflow-with-external-parameters.md).

## Exporting packages

To export packages, the resources exported must not contain default IDs. Therefore, the IDs of exportable resources must be changed by using a different name from the templates provided as standard by Adobe Campaign Standard.
For more information, see [Managing packages](../../automating/using/managing-packages.md).

## Exporting lists

The export list option allows you to export a maximum of 100,000 lines by default and defined by the Nms_ExportListLimit option. This option can be managed by the functional administrator, under the Administration > Application settings > Options menu.
For more information, see [Exporting lists](../../automating/using/exporting-lists.md).

## Troubleshooting

Adobe Campaign offers various logs to better understand your workflow issues.

### Using workflow logs

You can access workflow logs to monitor the execution of your activities. It indexes the operations carried out and execution errors by chronological order.
For more information, refer to [Monitoring workflow execution](../../automating/using/executing-a-workflow.md#monitoring).

### Using delivery logs

You can access workflow logs to monitor the success of your deliveries. Exclusion logs return excluded messages during preparation of the sending. Sending logs provide the status of the delivery for each profile.
For more information, refer to [Understanding delivery failures](../sending/using/understanding-delivery-failures.md).

### Using delivery alerting

The Delivery alerting feature is an alert management system that enables a group of users to automatically receive notifications containing information on the execution of their deliveries.
For more information, refer to [Delivery alerting](../../sending/using/receiving-alerts-when-failures-happen.md).
