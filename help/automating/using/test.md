## Description {#description}

![](assets/test.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Test]** activity enables a transition based on a test result.

## Context of use {#context-of-use}

A **Test** activity activates the first transition that satisfies the condition associated to it.

If no condition is satisfied and if the **Use default transition** option is activated, a default transition will be activated.

Conditions can be based on **functions**, or on **variables**, for example events variables that have been declared into the workflow's **[!UICONTROL External signal]** activity.

   When editing the **[!UICONTROL Condition]** field, two buttons provide help to call events variables and edit expressions combining variables and functions:

    * ![](assets/extsignal_picker.png): select the events variable among all variables that are available in the workflow (see [this page](../../automating/using/customizing-workflow-external-parameters.md))
