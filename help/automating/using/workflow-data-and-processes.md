# Workflow data and processes{#workflow-data-and-processes}

With Adobe Campaign, you can import, transform, filter, manage, and export data. These operations can be carried out to design and automate your business processes.

* Updating the database: install packages or upload data from files.
* Automating processes: through workflows, you can design your own processes to transform data, update the database, send messages, etc.
* Exporting data: export packages or sets of data in separate files.
