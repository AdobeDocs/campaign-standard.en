# Using Adobe Experience Platform audiences within workflows {#using-aep-audiences-within-workflows}

Once you have created an Adobe Experience Platform audience using the Unified Profile segment builder, you can use it in the same way as you would for a Campaign audience within Workflows to personalize and send messages.

To do this, you must configure a Read audience activity with the Adobe Experience Platform audience that you want to target, and (optional) specify the Adobe Experience Platform attributes you want to use to personalize messages with.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Push and in-app channels are not available yet for personalization using contextual data from Adobe Experience Platform.
