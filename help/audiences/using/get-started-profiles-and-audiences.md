Campaign integrated customer profiles allows you to track every interaction with customers across all channels within one single view, allowing you to deliver relevant and personalized messages to your customers.

Segment your database into audiences to optimize the target of your marketing campaigns.

Manage customers permission and consent using services and landing pages to set up easy opt-in and opt-out mechanisms.

## Segmenting and targeting {#segmenting-targeting}

<img src="assets/do-not-localize/icon_segment.svg" width="60px">

When you create campaigns or messages, you can specify the target of the deliveries by selecting from contacts in Campaign database, using simple or advanced criteria, or selecting audiences.

Identify customers more effectively across all your channels using **integrated customer profiles**, **customized segments** and **control groups**. When you know your customers, interests, demographics, and channel preferences, it’s easier to create personalized experiences that get noticed.

Adobe Campaign builds rich customer profiles in real time, allowing you to deliver more relevant and personalized offers as your customer’s preferences change. In addition, Adobe Campaign integrates advanced analysis, data management and targeting functionalities to build audiences.

**Profiles** are individual contacts stored in the database. Each profile corresponds to one entry in the database which contains the necessary information for that profile to be targeted, qualified and individually tracked: Adobe Campaign can track every interaction from both online and offline channels and merge it into a single profile.

**Audiences** are lists of profiles built on a specific criteria, or set of criteria. Using workflows and the query editor, you can construct audiences that will be targeted by your marketing campaigns, depending on the information that you have on them, their activities, and their marketing history. This allows you to filter subscribed profiles, sample, or create target audiences on an unlimited number of criteria.

## Permission and consent {#permission}

<img src="assets/do-not-localize/icon_permission.svg"  width="60px">

Before starting to send messages to a contact, you need to make sure that you get their permission. If not, your emails might be marked as a spam and this will impact your platform deliverability. To make sure to build a healthy profile database, secure this permission as a first step.

With Campaign, we recommend you to use **easy opt-in and opt-out mechanisms** through [services](../../audiences/using/creating-a-service.md), and [landing pages](../../channels/using/getting-started-with-landing-pages.md) to update your contact information and grow your database.

Providing **unsubscription links** in your messages will enable Profiles to be added to the denylist, when necessary, and therefore to improve your platform deliverability. For more on denylist management, refer to [About opt-in and opt-out in Campaign](../../audiences/using/about-opt-in-and-opt-out-in-campaign.md).
