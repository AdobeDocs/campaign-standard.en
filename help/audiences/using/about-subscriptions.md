# About subscriptions{#about-subscriptions}

About subscriptions

Adobe Campaign allows you to create and manage newsletters and cross-channel communications, through a set of **services**: messages can only be sent to profiles who subscribed to the service (opt-in). These profiles are identified using a dedicated filter when creating a message.

Subscription mechanisms can be set up to offer your customers a chance to subscribe to these services, notably though **emails** and **landing pages**.

Each service comes with:

* **Subscription** (opt-in) and **[!UICONTROL Unsubscription]** (opt-out) mechanisms.
* Subscription and/or unsubscription **confirmation mechanisms**.
* A subscription **history**.
