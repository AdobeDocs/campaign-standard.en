# About subscriptions{#about-subscriptions}

Adobe Campaign allows you to create and manage newsletters and cross-channel communications, through a set of **services**: messages can only be sent to profiles who subscribed to the service (opt-in). These profiles are identified using a dedicated filter when creating a message.

Subscription mechanisms can be set up to offer your customers a chance to subscribe to these services, notably though **emails** and **landing pages**.

Each service comes with:

* **Subscription** (opt-in) and **[!UICONTROL Unsubscription]** (opt-out) mechanisms.
* Subscription and/or unsubscription **confirmation mechanisms**.
* A subscription **history**.

Subscriptions can also be managed using the Adobe Campaign Standard API. For more on this, refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/en/api/ACS_API.html#managing-subscriptions) .
