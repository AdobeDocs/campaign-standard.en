# About the Audience Destinations service {#about-audiences}

In Adobe Campaign Standard, Profiles are individual contacts stored in the database, with information that enables marketers to build the desired targets for their campaign programs.

Adobe Campaigns Standard allows you to identify collections of profiles, known as Audiences, which are created by building segments (rules that include profile attributes and event data originating from Adobe Experience Platform). Global concepts on Unified Profile & Segmentation Services can be referenced in these dedicated documents.

Once an audience has been created, you can activate it for a delivery in Adobe Campaign Standard. Additionally, you can use contextual data from the Adobe Experience Platform to personalize and add dynamic content to your campaigns, if desired.

Terms used in this documentation:

* Profile: Profile is an Experience Platform standard data model used to define attributes of consumers. A profile can also be an aggregate of event data and attributes related to a person and or device.

    Example: "John Doe is a 55 years old male.”

* Segment: A set of rules that defines a subset of profiles from your database, using both attributes and event data.

    Example: “Males > 50 years old.”

* Audience: A collection of profiles that meet segment rules.

    Example: List of profiles corresponding to all males > 50 years old in your database.
