# Integrated customer profile{#integrated-customer-profile}

An integrated customer profile is available for each contact of your database. This marketing history combines all relevant marketing information concerning contact with a client into one single view. You can then access all digital behaviors, online and offline transactions in a central location: contact information, emails received, tracking logs, subscriptions and unsubscriptions, etc.

To access the integrated customer profile, steps are as follows:

1. From the Adobe Campaign home page, click the **[!UICONTROL Customer profiles]** card or the **Profiles** tab.
1. Select a contact.

You can then access the **Marketing history** of this contact.

Key information about the profile is gathered in this page, as well as the list of events.

Click an event in the list to open it: you can access the message which has been sent or the service which the profile has subscribed to.

>[!NOTE]

>Marketing history is also accessible using the Adobe Campaign Standard API. For more on this, refer to the [dedicated documentation](../../api/using/interacting-with-marketing-history.md) .
