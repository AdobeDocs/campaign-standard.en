# Monitoring deliverability{#monitoring-deliverability}

Below you will find details on the **[!UICONTROL Delivery throughput]** report as well as the different monitoring tools offered by Adobe Campaign. Here are some additional guidelines on deliverability monitoring:
* Regularly check the delivery throughput for the whole platform to verify whether it is consistent with the original set-up.
* Check that retries are set up correctly (30 minutes for retry period and more than 20 retries) in delivery templates.
* Regularly verify that the bounce mailbox is accessible and that the account is not about to expire.
* Check each delivery throughput to make sure that it is consistent with the delivery content's validity (e.g. 'flash sales' should be delivered in minutes, not days).
* When using waves, verify that each wave has enough time to finish before the next one is triggered.
* Check that the number of errors and new quarantines are consistent with other deliveries.
* Carefully consult the delivery logs in detail to check the kind of errors that are highlighted (grey or black-listing, DNS issues, anti-spam rules, etcâ€¦).

## Delivery throughput {#delivery-throughput}

You can configure the values displayed by changing the timescale.

Other reports are available, such as **[!UICONTROL Delivery summary]** or **[!UICONTROL Non-deliverables and bounces]**. For more on this, see [Dynamic reports](../../reporting/using/about-dynamic-reports.md).

## Monitoring deliveries {#monitoring-deliveries}

The message dashboard gives you access to the delivery logs: **[!UICONTROL Sending logs]**, **[!UICONTROL Exclusion logs]**, **[!UICONTROL Exclusion causes]**, **[!UICONTROL Tracking logs]** and **[!UICONTROL Tracked URLs]**. They show the detail of the sending, which target has been excluded and why, as well as the tracking information such as opens and clicks.
