# Confirming the send{#confirming-the-send}

Confirming the send

Once you have finished preparing your messages and the approval steps have been carried out, you can send them. For more on messages preparation, refer to [Preparing the send](../../sending/using/preparing-the-send.md).

Only users with the **Start deliveries** role can confirm send. For more on this, refer to the [List of roles](../../administration/using/list-of-roles.md) section.

Users without this role will see the following message:

To send your delivery, click the **Confirm send** button found in the message's action bar.

You will be asked to finalize the send definitively by clicking the **OK** button.

The message is being sent.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the message is scheduled, it will be sent when sending time is reached. For more on scheduling messages, refer to [this section](../../sending/using/about-scheduling-messages.md).

The **Deployment** block shows the progress of the send.

Once the message is sent to the contacts, the **Deployment** zone shows your KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) data , including:

* The number of messages to deliver
* The number of messages sent
* The percentage of messages delivered
* The percentage of bounces and errors
* The percentage of open messages
* The percentage of clicks in the messages (for emails)

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >The **Open rate** and **Click-through rate** are updated every hour.

If the KPIs take too long to update or don't take into account the results from the sending logs, click the **Compute stats** button in the **Deployment** window.

The message can be viewed in the history of one of the client profiles that makes up part of the audience. See [Integrated customer profile](../../audiences/using/integrated-customer-profile.md).

Once a message is sent, you can track the behavior of its recipients, and monitor it in order to measure its impact. For more on this, refer to these sections:

* [Tracking messages](../../sending/using/tracking-messages.md)
* [Monitoring a delivery](../../sending/using/monitoring-a-delivery.md)
