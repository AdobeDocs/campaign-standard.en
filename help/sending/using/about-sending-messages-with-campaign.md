# Get started with testing and sending {#about-sending-messages-with-campaign}

Once you have defined the target and created the content of a message, you need to test and approve content, personalization, rendering and configuration, and make sure everything is correct before sending the message to the main target. 

To do this, best practices are to:

* Prepare the send: this step allows you to move to analyzing and preparing messages to send. The message preparation analyzes the target, the personalization and the validity of the message. Errors detected during this step must be corrected before being able to proceed further. You can launch the message preparation as many times as needed. For more on message preparation, refer to [this section](../../sending/using/preparing-the-send.md).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >You can set global cross-channel fatigue rules that will automatically exclude oversollicited profiles from campaigns. See [Fatigue rules](../../sending/using/fatigue-rules.md).

* Preview messages by using a test profile. For more on previewing messages, refer to [this section](../../sending/using/previewing-messages.md).
* Send proofs to test messages. For more on proofs, refer to [this  section](../../sending/using/sending-proofs.md). 
* Check the message rendering: make sure that your message will be displayed in an optimal way on a variety of web clients, web mails and devices. Learn more about Email rendering in [this section](../../sending/using/email-rendering.md).

You can then:

* Schedule the sending: you can define when messages will be sent. For example, you can adapt sending at the recipient's timezone, optimize the sending time or compute the  sending date. Learn more in [this section](../../sending/using/about-scheduling-messages.md).
* Send the message: once the message ready, you can start the sending. Access logs and reports are then available to monitor the message delivery and measure the success of your campaign. Adobe Campaign also provides an email alerting system to keep track of delivery successes or failures. Learn more in [this page](../../sending/using/confirming-the-send.md).
