# About testing and sending

About testing and sending

Once you have defined the target and created the content of a message, you need to test it and to approve it before sending it to the main target. To do this:

* Preview your delivery to display it using a test profile.
* Schedule the sending: define when to send the message.
* Prepare the send: this step allows you to move to analyzing and preparing messages to send. The message preparation analyzes the target, the personalization and the validity of the message. Errors detected during this step must be corrected before being able to proceed further. You can launch the message preparation as many times as needed.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >You can set global cross-channel fatigue rules that will automatically exclude oversollicited profiles from campaigns. See [Fatigue rules](../../administration/using/working-with-typology-rules.md#fatigue-rules).

* Test the send: this step allows you to approve the message by sending proofs.
* Approve the rendering: this step allows you to configure the email deliverability check (optional).
* Send the message: according to the sending schedule, confirm the message preparation and start the sending. Access logs and reports to monitor the delivery of your message and to measure the success of your campaign. Adobe Campaign also provides an email alerting system to keep track of delivery successes or failures.
