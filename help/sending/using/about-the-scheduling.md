# About the scheduling

About the scheduling

In the delivery dashboard, the **Schedule** block allows you to choose when you want to send the message.

![](assets/delivery_dashboard.png)

The **Schedule** screen has two options:

![](assets/delivery_planning.png)

* **Messages to be sent once confirmed**: The message is sent as soon as the send is confirmed. See [Confirming send](../../sending/using/confirming-send.md).
* **Messages to be sent automatically on the date specified below**: The message will be sent at a later date and time. Specify the **contact date** in the **Start sending from** field.

  You can prepare and confirm the send, but the messages will only be sent on the selected date and time.

  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >Whenever making changes to a deliveryâ€™s schedule, be sure to re-prepare the delivery by clicking on the **Prepare** button before clicking **Confirm**.

  Preparing and confirming the send are presented in the [Preparing the send](../../sending/using/preparing-the-send.md) and [Confirming send](../../sending/using/confirming-send.md) sections.

  The **Time zone of the contact date** drop-down list allows you to modify the time zone that will be taken into account for the sending time.

  For example, if you enter 9:00 AM in the **Start sending from** field and if you select Brussels, Copenhagen, Madrid, Paris (GMT+1) in the **Time zone of the contact date** drop-down list, all recipients will receive the message at 9:00 AM Paris time. Therefore, a recipient located in Moscow (GMT+3) will receive the message at 11:00 AM Moscow time.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >The default time zone is the time zone the user is currently in.

  If you would like to manually confirm the send, check the **Request confirmation before sending messages** box. This option is enabled by default.

  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >When duplicating a delivery, all scheduling settings are deleted. Unless you schedule a new contact date, the duplicated delivery will be sent as soon as the send is confirmed.
