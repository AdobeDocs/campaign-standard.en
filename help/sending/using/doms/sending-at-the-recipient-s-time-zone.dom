  <p>When managing a campaign in which the date and time are important, you can schedule a delivery that takes each recipient's local time into account.</p> 
  <p>To use this functionality, make sure that all profiles targeted by your delivery have a time zone specified in the <strong>Address</strong> section of their properties. If a profile's <strong>Time zone</strong> is not specified, the message will be sent to the corresponding recipient as soon as the send is confirmed (not at the scheduled time). For more information on accessing profile properties, see <a href="../../audiences/using/editing-profiles.md">Editing profiles</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Example</strong></p> 
  <p>You want to send a promotional code that is only valid on Valentine's Day to all your customers around the world. To provide sufficient time to use it during the day, all customers must receive your message on February 14th at 8:00 AM.</p> 
  <ol>
   <li><p>In the delivery's <strong>Schedule</strong> window, select <strong>Messages to be sent automatically on the date specified below</strong>.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Set the contact date (February 14th at 8:00 AM) in the <strong>Start sending from</strong> field.</p> <img alt="" captionBottom="" imageRotate="0" src="assets/send-time_opt_valentine.png" title="" /></li>
   <li><p>From the send time optimization drop-down menu, choose <strong>Send at the recipient's time zone</strong>.</p> </li>
   <li><p><strong>Prepare</strong> and <strong>Confirm</strong> your delivery.</p> 
    <note>
     <p> Make sure to confirm the send at least 24 hours in advance. Otherwise, depending on their locations, some recipients might receive the message as soon as the delivery is confirmed and not at the scheduled time. </p> 
    </note></li>
  </ol>
  <p>No matter where they are located, all recipients will receive the message on February 14th at 8:00 AM their local time.</p>
