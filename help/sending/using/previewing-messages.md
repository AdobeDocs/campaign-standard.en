Previewing messages

After adding test profiles in the **[!UICONTROL Audience]** window, you can preview your message to check its personalization and how your recipients will see your delivery.

## Previewing messages with the content editor {#previewing-messages-with-the-content-editor}

In the [content editor](../../designing/using/about-personalization.md), preview is available in HTML and text format.

The preview screen comes with a device mode that allows you to simulate a wide range of devices. You can select the device that you want to emulate in the dropdown list. The  ![](assets/toggleOrientation24px.png)

button lets you control the orientation between portrait and landscape.

For emails, an automatic anti-spam checking is performed during each preview. Click the **[!UICONTROL Show anti-spam analysis]** button to find out more about the warning.
