# Previewing deliveries {#previewing-messages}

## Previewing emails {#previewing-emails}

Campaign Standard allows you to preview messages before sending, in order to check their personalization and how your recipients will see them.

Messages preview is performed using **Test profiles** that you add to the message's target.

For **email** messages, Campaign Standard allows you to preview messages using targeted profiles rather than test profiles. This allows you to get an exact representation of the message that a specific profile will receive. For more on this, see [Testing email messages using targeted profiles](../../sending/using/testing-messages-using-target.md).

To preview a message using test profiles, follow these steps:

1. In the [Email Designer](../../designing/using/designing-content-in-adobe-campaign.md), click the **[!UICONTROL Preview]** button.

   A desktop view and a responsive mobile view of your email are displayed side by side.

1. An automatic anti-spam checking is performed during each preview. Click the **[!UICONTROL Anti-spam analysis]** button to find out more about the warning.
