Data model concepts

Adobe Campaign comes with a pre-defined data model. This data model can be modified by administrators with new resources or extensions to existing resources.

The **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Development]** menu, accessed via the Adobe Campaign logo, allows you to manage your **custom resources**, **publish** them, and **access the diagnostic tools**.

The data used by Adobe Campaign is defined through different resources.

You can **enrich the data template** that is provided by creating your own custom resources, such as purchase or product tables.

Out-of-the-box resources (such as campaigns, emails, or audiences) cannot be modified. However, custom resources can be extended to add new fields.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can find a datamodel representation for the out-of-the-box resources [here](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/en/datamodel/datamodel.html).

You can also **configure the navigation** in the screens corresponding to the resource created.

Extension fields are generated with a prefix so that they never conflict with the out-of-the-box fields.
