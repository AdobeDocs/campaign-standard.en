# Data model description{#data-model-introduction}

Adobe Campaign comes with a pre-defined data model. 

The Adobe Campaign Standard data model displays the built-in SQL structure for a set of marketing-related resources.

This section is intended for Campaign experts or developers.

For each resource, you will find in the sub-pages a table which lists the SQL fields with available characteristics, such as: internal name, type and enumeration details. Built-in filters associated to the resource are also listed. Each filter comes with its parameters list.

>[!NOTE]
>Campaign data model can be modified by [administrators](../../administration/using/users-management.md#functional-administrators) only.
