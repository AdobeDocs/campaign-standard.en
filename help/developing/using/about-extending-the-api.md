# About extending the API{#about-extending-the-api}

This use case details the exposition of extended fields for the custom resource Profiles in the public Profiles API. For example, to instantly update a customer's profile with a promo code generated from a billing system.

>In order to publish the API, make sure you have the **[!UICONTROL Datamodel]** role.

The steps to expose extended fields in the public API are as follows:

1. [Add the extension fields to the Profile resource](../../developing/using/step-1--add-extension-fields-to-the-profile-resource.md)
1. [Publish the extension](../../developing/using/step-2--publish-the-extension.md)
1. [Verify that the new extended fields are available in the API](../../developing/using/step-3--verify-the-extension.md)
