# About extending the API{#about-extending-the-api}

This use case details the exposition of the extended fields for the custom resource Profiles in the public Profiles API. For example, to instantly update a customer's profile with a promo code generated from a billing system.

In order to publish the API, you need to have the **[!UICONTROL Datamodel]** role.

* Extending the Profiles custom resource
* Publishing the extension
