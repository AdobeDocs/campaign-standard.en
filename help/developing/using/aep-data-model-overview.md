Experience Data Model (XDM) is a standard set of data schemas into which data might be ingested for use with Adobe Experience Platform solutions and products.

The creation and management of XDM schemas is available with a dedicated API or with the XDM user interface.

## XDM workspace {#xdm-workspace}

XDM Workspace affords the ability to view, create, and extend data schemas.

To access the XDM user interface, open Adobe Experience Platform. Navigate to the Data Model window to create or extend an XDM schema.
