# Step 1: Define the resource{#step-define-the-resource}

Step 1: Define the resource

Administrators can create a new resource from scratch or create an extension of an existing resource if you need work on data that are not part of the out-of-the-box data model.

1. From **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Development]** > **[!UICONTROL Custom Resources]** , click the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button.
1. Choose the action you want to perform:

    * **[!UICONTROL Create a new resource]** : Enter the **[!UICONTROL Label]** and **[!UICONTROL ID]** fields. The **[!UICONTROL ID]** field is mandatory. If you leave the Label field empty, it will automatically be completed from the ID.

    * **[!UICONTROL Extend an existing resource]** : Select the resource you want to extend.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]** to create the resource, which will then take on the **[!UICONTROL Draft]** status in case of new resource or the **[!UICONTROL Editing]** status in case of extension.

The new resource is created and can now be configured.
