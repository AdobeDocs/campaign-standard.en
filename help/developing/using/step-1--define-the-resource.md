# Step 1: Define the resource{#step-define-the-resource}

Step 1: Define the resource

Administrators can create a new resource from scratch or create an extension of an existing resource if you need work on data that are not part of the out-of-the-box data model.

1. From **Administration** > **Development** > **Custom Resources**, click the **Create** button.
1. Choose the action you want to perform:

    * **Create a new resource**: Enter the **Label** and **ID** fields. The **ID** field is mandatory. If you leave the Label field empty, it will automatically be completed from the ID.

    * **Extend an existing resource**: Select the resource you want to extend.

1. Click **Create** to create the resource, which will then take on the **Draft** status in case of new resource or the **Editing** status in case of extension.

The new resource is created and can now be configured.
