# Adding a personalization field

Adding a personalization field

Adobe Campaign allows you to insert a field from the database into your page such as the recipient's first name. Once personalization is generated (when previewing and preparing the email or when testing the landing page for example), this field will be replaced by the value corresponding to the targeted recipient.

To add a personalization field to the content, click inside a text block and use the **Insert personalization field** button in the toolbar (refer to [Toolbar](../../designing/using/content-editor-interface.md#toolbar)).

Select the personalization block that you would like to insert into your page content. The available fields vary depending on the context (email or landing page).

For emails and SMS messages created from a workflow, the additional data computed in the workflow is also available in the personalization fields. For more information about adding additional data from a workflow, refer to the [Enriching data](../../automating/using/targeting-data.md#enriching-data) section.

The field name appears in the editor and it is highlighted in blue.
