# Personalizing an image source{#personalizing-an-image-source}

Personalizing an image source

Adobe Campaign allows you to personalize one or several images in your message according to a particular criterion or to use tracking. This is done by inserting personalization fields, content blocks, or dynamic content into the image source. To do this:

1. Insert an image into the content of your message, or select an image that is already present.
1. In the image properties palette, check the **[!UICONTROL Enable personalization]** option.

   The **[!UICONTROL Source]** field is displayed and the image selected is shown as **personalized** in the editor.

1. Click the pencil next to the **[!UICONTROL Source]** field button to access the personalization options.
1. After having added the image source, add the personalization fields, content blocks, and dynamic contents that you like.

   >The domain name (http://mydomain.com) cannot be personalized, it has to be entered manually. The rest of the URL can be personalized. For example: http://mydomain.com/[Gender].jpg

1. Confirm your changes.
