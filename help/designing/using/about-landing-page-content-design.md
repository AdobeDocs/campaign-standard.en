* [Managing landing page structure and style](../../designing/using/managing-landing-page-structure-and-style.md)
* [Changing a landing page form data properties](../../designing/using/changing-a-landing-page-form-data-properties.md)

To know more about actions that are common to one or more marketing activities, refer to the following sections:

* For more on personalizing a landing page content, see [Inserting a personalization field](../../designing/using/inserting-a-personalization-field.md) and [Adding a content block](../../designing/using/adding-a-content-block.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your instance was installed before the Adobe Campaign Standard 19.0 release, you still have access to the legacy email content editor. The interface, principles of use and configuration are mostly the same as described below for landing pages. However, all features may not be available or maintained in the legacy email content editor, which is deprecated starting 19.0 release. To quickly edit your email content through a drag and drop interface with extended functionalities, use the [Email Designer](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#about-the-email-designer).
