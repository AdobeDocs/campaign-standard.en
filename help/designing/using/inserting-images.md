Inserting images

You can insert images in your emails and landing pages.

The following types of images are available, depending on your configuration:

* local images
* images shared from Adobe Experience Cloud - refer to [Working with Campaign and Assets Core Service](../../integrating/using/working-with-campaign-and-assets-core-service.md) / Assets On Demand
* dynamic images from Adobe Target (only available when using the [content editor](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#using-the-email-content-editor)) - refer to [Working with Campaign and Target](../../integrating/using/about-campaign-target-integration.md)

If enabled, you can modify images with the Adobe Creative SDK. See [Modifying images with the Adobe Creative SDK](../../designing/using/modifying-images-with-the-adobe-creative-sdk.md).

This section describes how to add images to an email using the [Creative Designer](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#using-the-creative-designer). If you are using the [content editor](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#using-the-email-content-editor), see [Inserting images in a landing page](../../designing/using/inserting-images.md#inserting-images-in-a-landing-page) as the process is the same.

1. Inside this structure component, add an **Image** content component.
