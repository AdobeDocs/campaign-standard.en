# Inserting a link{#inserting-a-link}

Inserting a link

The editor allows you to personalize an email or landing page by inserting links into the HTML content elements.

You can insert a link into any page element: image, word, group of words, block of text, etc.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The images below show how to insert a link using the [Creative Designer](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#using-the-creative-designer).

1. Select an element and click **Insert link** from the toolbar.

1. Choose the type of link you want to create:

    * **Link to an external URL**: allows you to add a link to a URL.

      You can define personalization for your URLs. See [Personalizing URLs](../../designing/using/personalizing-urls.md).
    
    * **Link that defines an action**: allows you to define an action when an element in the landing page is clicked.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >This type of link is only available for landing pages.

    * **Link to a landing page**: allows you to access an Adobe Campaign landing page.
    * **Subscription link**: allows you to insert a link to subscribe to an Adobe Campaign service.
    * **Unsubscription link**: allows you to insert a link to unsubscribe from an Adobe Campaign service.

1. Modify the link parameters as needed:

    * You can modify the text displayed to the profile.
    * You can edit the link type: URL, action, landing page, or service.
    * You can set the browser behavior when the user clicks the link (for example, open a new window).

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >Defining the browser behavior only apply to landing pages.

1. Validate the link creation.

Once the link is created, you can still modify it by selecting it and re-opening the link popup or by editing the link target directly in the settings of the element displayed in the left panel.

When editing an email with the [Creative Designer](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#using-the-creative-designer), you can easily access and modify the links that you created from the table listing all the URLs included in the email. This list enables you to have a centralized view and to locate each URL in the email content. To access it, see [About tracked URLs](../../designing/using/about-tracked-urls.md).

>Personalized URLs such as **Mirror page URL** or **Unsubscription** link cannot be modified from this list. All other links are editable.
