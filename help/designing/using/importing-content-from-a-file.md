# Importing content from a file{#importing-content-from-a-file}

Importing content from a file

From the Email Designer home page, click the **[!UICONTROL Upload]** button to upload a file from your computer, then confirm.

There are no constraints on the zip file structure. However, referencing HTML files has to be relative and respect the tree structure of the zip folder.

The following formats are supported for import:

* An HTML file with an incorporated style sheet
* A .zip folder containing the HTML file, the style sheet (.CSS) and the images

>[!NOTE]
>
>For email content, we recommend that you import single HTML files with an incorporated style sheet.
