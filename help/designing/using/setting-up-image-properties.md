# Setting up image properties{#setting-up-image-properties}

Setting up image properties

When you select a block that contains an image, the following properties are offered in the palette:

* **Enable personalization** allows you to customize the image source. See [Personalizing an image source](../../designing/using/personalizing-an-image-source.md).
* **Image Title** lets you define a title for the image.
* **Alt text** (email) or **Caption** (landing page) lets you define the caption linked to the image (corresponds to the **alt** HTML attribute).
* When editing an email, **Style** lets you specify the image size, background, and border.
* When editing a landing page, **Dimensions** lets you specify the image size in pixels.

>The editor allows you to work with **all image types** whose formats are compatible with browsers. To be compatible with the editor, the **"Flash" type animations** have to be inserted in an HTML page as follows: >[!VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/http://www.mydomain.com/flash/your_animation.swf)
