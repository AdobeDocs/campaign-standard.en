# Personalizing URLs{#personalizing-urls}

Adobe Campaign allows you to personalize one or several URLs in your message by adding personalization fields, content blocks, or dynamic content to them. To do this:

1. Insert an external URL and specify its parameters. See [Inserting a link](../../designing/using/inserting-a-link.md).
1. If not displayed, click the pencil next to the selected URL in the Settings pane to access the personalization options.
1. Add the personalization fields, content blocks, and dynamic contents that you want to use.

1. Save your changes.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Personalizing URLs cannot be applied to the domain name, nor to the URL extension. An error message will be displayed during message analysis if personalization is incorrect. When selecting a content block, you are not allowed to select elements such as **Link to mirror page**. This type of blocks is forbidden inside a link.
