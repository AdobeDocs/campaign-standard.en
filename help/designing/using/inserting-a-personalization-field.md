# Inserting a personalization field{#inserting-a-personalization-field}

Inserting a personalization field

Adobe Campaign allows you to insert a field from the database into your page such as the profile's first name.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The images below show how to insert a personalization field using the [Email Designer](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#using-the-email-designer) for an email.

To add a personalization field to the content:

1. Click inside a text block, click the **Personalize** icon from the contextual toolbar and select **Insert personalization field**. For more on the Email Designer interface, see [this section](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#about-the-email-designer-interface).

Once personalization is generated (when previewing and preparing the email for example), this field will be replaced by the value corresponding to the targeted profile.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the email is created from a workflow, the additional data computed in the workflow is also available in the personalization fields. For more information about adding additional data from a workflow, refer to the [Enriching data](../../automating/using/targeting-data.md#enriching-data) section.
