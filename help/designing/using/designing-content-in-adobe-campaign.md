# Campaign Email Designer{#designing-content-in-adobe-campaign}

Once you have created an email in Adobe Campaign, you need to define its content.

<!--The Email Designer has more features than the Legacy Editor and is backward compatible.-->

* To discover how to create email content, see [Quick start](../../designing/using/quick-start.md).
* For an overview of the Email Designer, see [Using the Email Designer](../../designing/using/overview.md).
* For more on building content: 
  * From scratch, see [Designing emails from scratch](../../designing/using/designing-from-scratch.md).
  * Using existing content, see [Designing using existing content](../../designing/using/using-existing-content.md).
  * Using integrations, see [Multi-solution email design](../../designing/using/using-integrations.md).
* For more on Personalization, see [Personalization](../../designing/using/personalization.md).

When creating an email , you can choose to use a predefined template or to load an existing content from another source. See [Selecting an existing content](../../designing/using/using-existing-content.md#selecting-an-existing-content).

To increase the efficiency of your marketing campaigns, personalize your content. See [Inserting a personalization field](../../designing/using/personalization.md#inserting-a-personalization-field) and [Adding a content block](../../designing/using/personalization.md#adding-a-content-block).

You can also define dynamic content that varies depending on each profile. See [Defining dynamic content in an email](../../designing/using/personalization.md#defining-dynamic-content-in-an-email) and [Defining dynamic content in a landing page](../../channels/using/designing-a-landing-page.md#defining-dynamic-content-in-a-landing-page).

Enhance your messages and landing pages with links and images. See [Inserting a link](../../designing/using/links.md#inserting-a-link) and [Inserting images](../../designing/using/images.md#inserting-images).
