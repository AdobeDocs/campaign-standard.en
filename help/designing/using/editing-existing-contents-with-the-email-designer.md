<!--# Editing existing contents with the Email Designer{#editing-existing-contents-with-the-email-designer}

To fully leverage the edition possibilities of the [Email Designer](../../designing/using/overview.md), your uploaded HTML must contain specific tagging that makes it compliant with the WYSIWYG editor.

If all or part of the HTML does not have this tagging, the content is then loaded in ' [compatibility mode](../../designing/using/using-existing-content.md#compatibility-mode)'.

To make an existing external content fully editable within the Email Designer, see the [Designing an email using existing contents](../../designing/using/using-existing-content.md) section.-->
