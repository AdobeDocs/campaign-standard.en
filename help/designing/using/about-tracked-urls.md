About tracked URLs

In the email content, a menu summarizes all the URLs of your content that will be tracked.

The **[!UICONTROL Links]** icon in the action bar automatically displays the list of all the URLs included in an email content.

Tracking is activated by default.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This functionality is only available for emails and if tracking has been activated in Adobe Campaign. For more on the tracking parameters, refer to [this section](../../administration/using/configuring-email-channel.md#list-of-email-tracking-parameters).

The URL, category, label, and tracking type of each link can be modified directly from this list.

For each tracked URL, you can activate or deactivate tracking.

>By default in Adobe Campaign, all content URLs are tracked except **Mirror page URL** and **Unsubscription** link.

You can regroup your URLs by editing the **[!UICONTROL Category]** field, depending on the URLs used in the message.
