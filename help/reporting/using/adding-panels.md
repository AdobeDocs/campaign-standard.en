# Adding panels

Adding panels

## Adding a blank panel

To start your report, you can add a set of panels to an out of the box or custom report. Each panel contains different data sets and is composed of freeform tables and visualizations.

This panel allows you to build your reports as needed. You can add as many panels as you want in your reports in order to filter your data with different time periods.

1. Click the **Panels** icon. You can also add a panel by clicking the **Insert tab** and selecting **New Blank Panel**.

You can now add a freeform table to your panel to start targeting data.

## Adding a freeform table

Freeform tables allow you to create a table to analyze your data using the different metrics and dimensions available in the **Component** table.

Each table and visualization is resizable and can be moved to better customize your report.

1. Click the **Panels** icon.

   The **Column settings** is composed of:

    * **Number**: lets you show or hide summary numbers in the column.
    * **Percent**: lets you show or hide percent in the column.
    * **Interpret zero as no value**: lets you show or hide when value equals zero.
    * **Background**: lets you show or hide the horizontal progress bar in cells.
    * **Include retries**: lets you include retries in the result. This is only available for **Sent** and **Bounces + Errors**.

1. Select one or multiple rows and click the **Visualize** icon. A visualization is added to reflect the rows you have selected.
