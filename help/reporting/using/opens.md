Opens

The **Opens** report identifies the deliveries that have been most viewed by recipients.

Four tables and charts break down the total number of recipients who opened an email based upon:

* Browser
* Device
* Platform
* Domain

The **TOP 5** table and graph display the deliveries with the highest number of delivered messages.
