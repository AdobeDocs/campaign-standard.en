Each table is represented by summary numbers and charts. You can change how the details are shown in their respective visualization settings.

* **[!UICONTROL Delivered]** : The number of messages successfully sent, in relation to the total number of sent messages. Errors raised (bounces) are taken into account. However, complaints (spam declarations) and away messages such as "out of office" are not taken into account.
