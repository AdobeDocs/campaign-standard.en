# Breakdown by domains{#breakdown-by-domains}

This report contains the performance data for each domain represented in the audience for an email delivery. If it is a campaign or program report, the performance data is available for multiple audiences. This data allows you to analyze the behavior of each domain in reaction to specific events. For example, link display, URL blacklisting, etc.

* **Hard bounce**: The total number of permanent errors, such as a wrong email address.
