>[!CAUTION]

>Please note that you have to drag and drop the **[!UICONTROL Message type]** metrics to your tables to split your data depending on your delivery types, in this case In-App deliveries.

The **In-App** report provides details related to In-App deliveries.

Each table is represented by summary numbers and charts. You can change how the details are shown in their respective visualization settings.
