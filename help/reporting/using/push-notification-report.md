# Push notification report{#push-notification-report}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Please note that you have to drag and drop the **[!UICONTROL Message type]** metrics to your tables to split your data depending on your delivery types, in this case push notification deliveries.

The **Push notification** report provides details of marketing performance of push notifications in Adobe Campaign. This out-of-the-box report will help you understand how users interact with push notifications, mobile applications and deliveries.

Some configuration is required in the mobile application to implement push tracking, refer to this [page](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/push-tracking.html) for the detailed steps.

Each table is represented by summary numbers and charts. You can change how the details are shown in their respective visualization settings.

* **[!UICONTROL Processed/sent]**: Total number of push notifications sent.
