# Push notification report{#push-notification-report}

Push notification report

The **Push notification** report provides details related to push notifications. For example, delivered and open rates.

Each table is represented by summary numbers and charts. You can change how the details are shown in their respective visualization settings.

The first table, **Push summary**, contains the data available for sent push notification:

* **Processed/Sent**: Total number of sends for the delivery.
* **Delivered**: Number of push notifications successfully sent, in relation to the total number of sent messages.
* **Open**: Number of time a user's interaction with Push notification causes the App to be launched.

The following two tables, **Mobile app repartition** and **Platform repartition**, contain the available data for push notifications. This data depends upon:

* The mobile applications used to send the push notifications.
* The recipients' mobile operating systems.
