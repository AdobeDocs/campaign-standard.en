# Push notification report{#push-notification-report}

Push notification report

The **Push notification** report provides details related to push notifications. For example, delivered and open rates.

![](assets/dynamic_report_push.png)

Each table is represented by summary numbers and charts. You can change how the details are shown in their respective visualization settings.

The first table, **Push summary**, contains the data available for sent push notification:

* **Processed/Sent**: Total number of sends for the delivery.
* **Delivered**: Number of push notifications successfully sent, in relation to the total number of sent messages.
* **Open**: Number of time a user's interaction with Push notification causes the App to be launched.

The following two tables, **Mobile app repartition** and **Platform repartition**, contain the available data for push notifications. This data depends upon:

* The mobile applications used to send the push notifications.
* The recipients' mobile operating systems.
