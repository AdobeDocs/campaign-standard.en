# Counting

The Adobe Campaign REST API can count the number of records in a request. To do this, use the URL that is returned in the **count** node.

<br/>

***Sample request***

To count all the services that have a **messageType** value equaling to "sms", perform a GET request with the **byChannel** filter.

```

-X GET https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/service/byChannel?channel=sms \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>'

```

It returns the services corresponding to the filter.

```

{
    "content": [
        {
            ...
            "messageType": "sms",
            "mode": "newsletter",
            "name": "SVC6",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ],
    "count": {
        "href": "https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/service/byChannel/_count?channel=sms&_lineStart=@iKTZ2q3IiSEDqZ5Nw1vdoGnQCqF-8DAUJRaVwR9obqqTxhMy"
    },
    "serverSidePagination": true
}

```

Perform a GET request on the **count** node's URL to retrieve the number of results.

```

-X GET https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/service/byChannel/_count?channel=sms&_lineStart=@iKTZ2q3IiSEDqZ5Nw1vdoGnQCqF-8DAUJRaVwR9obqqTxhMy \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>'

```

It returns the number of records.

```

{
    "count": 26
}

```
