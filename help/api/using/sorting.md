# Sorting

Sorting is available by default in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append **%20desc** to the **_order** parameter's value.

To know if a field can be sorted, check the "sortable" parameter into the resource metadata. For more on this, refer to [this section](../../api/using/metadata-mechanism.md).
