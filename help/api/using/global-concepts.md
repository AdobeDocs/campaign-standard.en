# Global concepts {#global-concepts}

## Technical requirements

* Adobe Campaign APIs must be used Server to Server only.

* Please always check with your Adobe technical contact if the use case you want to implement is aligned with the scale allowed by Adobe Campaign APIs.

* Setting up an AdobeIO access requires specific permissions, contact the Adobe Support for any trouble.

## Primary keys & URLs

* The automatic primary key (PKey) values generated by Adobe Campaign must never be stored into an external database or website. You have to configure your tables with **custom keys**.

* The automatic primary key (PKey) values that illustrate the examples are not intended to work in another specific deployment. They are produced by the Adobe Campaign API.

* **Do not try to build an URL by yourself**. All the URLs are returned by the API. However, it is possible to build an URL based on the top-level resource name.

## Resources representation

All API resources are available in **JSON** with an URL extension or inside an HTTP Accept Header.

`GET /profileAndServices/<resourceName>.json`

>[!NOTE]
>
>Without extension in the URL, the **json format is the default one** for the content-type.

```shell
$curl
-X GET https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/profile.json \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>'
```
