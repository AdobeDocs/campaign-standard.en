# Creating a privacy request {#creating-a-privacy-request}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The [Privacy Core Service](https://adobe.io/apis/cloudplatform/gdpr.html) Integration is the method you should use for all access and delete requests. Starting 19.4, the use of the Campaign API and interface for access and delete requests is deprecated. For more on Campaign Standard deprecated and removed features, refer to [this page](../../rn/using/deprecated-features.md).

Privacy requests are created using a **POST** request.

Before creating requests, you need to define the namespace you will use. For more on this, refer the [Privacy management documentation](../../start/using/privacy-requests.md).

The payload must contain the following parameters:

* **name**: a unique internal name
* **namespace**: the namespace name configured in Campaign Standard interface
* **reconciliationValue**: the reconciliation value based on the reconciliation key defined in the namespace
* **label**: the request label
* **type**: the request type. Accepted values are "access" or "delete".
* **regulation**: the regulation type. Example: "GDPR", "CCPA". This parameter is mandatory, and available starting Campaign Standard 19.4 release. If you are on an older build, you do not need to add it to your payload.

***Sample request***

This POST request creates a privacy request based on a email reconciliation key defined in the namespace AMCDS2:

```

-X POST https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/privacy/privacyTool \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8'

{
"name":"PT11832",
"namespaceName": "AMCDS2",
"reconciliationValue": "customers@adobe.com",
"regulation": "gdpr",
"label":"Delete customers",
"type":"delete"
}

```

Response to the POST request.
