# Controlling a workflow {#controlling-a-workflow}

You can control a workflow directly from the REST API, through a POST request containing the workflow ID and the required execution command:

`POST https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/workflow/execution/<workflowID>/commands`

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If the worfklow ID is changed in Adobe Campaign, the API request will not work anymore.

Four execution commands are available to control a workflow:

* Start
* Pause
* Resume
* Stop

For more information on the execution commands, refer to the [Campaign documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/managing-processes-and-data/executing-a-workflow/about-workflow-execution.html).
