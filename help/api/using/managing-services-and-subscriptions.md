# Managing services and subscriptions {#managing-services-and-subscriptions}

## Creating a service

Services creation is performed with a **POST** request on the service resource.

If you want to create the service with specific attributes, add them into the payload. Otherwise, the new service will be created with default ones.

<br/>

***Sample request***

Sample POST request to create a service with specific attributes.

```

-X POST https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/service/ \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>'
-i
-d {
-d "label": "My newsletter",
-d "messageType": "email",
-d "name": "email_newsletter",
-d "start": "2019-10-06"
-d }

```

It returns the newly created service with the updated attributes.

```

{
    "PKey": "<PKEY>",
    "builtIn": false,
    "created": "2019-09-26 12:00:37.005Z",
    "href": "https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/profileAndServices/service/@NLscZuVHxdVu9rPftvrMWFfR1zRIxQGswSOmGLrK09JTF_iWhB0JCUHEndA_vvy__k9mzOYa5NVkcWDcrK8qGh0wygahX9kRcD44kiWWSEceShn3",
    "label": "My newsletter",
    ...
}

```

## Retrieving subscriptions

### Retrieving the profiles that subscribed to a service

This is a two-steps procedure.

1. Retrieve the subscriptions URL for the desired service.
1. Perform a GET request on the subscriptions URL. It returns the list of subscriptions for the service, with each associated profile.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The REST API returns the "href" property, which contains the URL to use. <b>Always use the URL contained in the response to make the subsequent API request</b>.

<br/>

***Sample request***

Perform a GET request to retrieve the service.

```

-X GET https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/service/<PKEY> \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>'

```

It returns the subscriptions URL for the service.

```

  {
    ...
    "messageType": "email",
    "name": "SVC1",
    "subscriptions": {
                "href": "https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/service/<PKEY>/subscriptions/"
    },
    ...
  },

```

Perform a GET request on the subscriptions URL.

```

-X GET https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/service/<PKEY>/subscriptions \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>'

```

The list of subscriptions for the service displays, with each associated profile.

```

  {
    ...
    "service": ...,
    "serviceName": "SVC3",
    "subscriber": {
        "PKey": "<PKEY>",
        "email": "",

        "href": "https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/profile/<PKEY>",
        "lastName": "Doe",
    },
  }

```
