# Performing subscriptions {#performing-subscriptions}

## Method 1: Subscribing a profile to a service

Perform a GET request to retrieve the profile.

```

-X GET https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/profile/<PKEY> \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>'

```

It returns the subscriptions URL for the profile.

```

  {
    ...
    "postalAddress":...,
    "preferredLanguage": "none",
    "subscriptions": {
      "href": "https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/profile/<PKEY>/subscriptions/"
    },
    ...
  }

```

Perform a POST request on the subscriptions URL with the desired service Primary Key inside the payload.

```

-X POST https://mc.adobe.io/<ORGANIZATION>/campaign/profileAndServices/profile/<PKEY>/subscriptions \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
-H 'X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>' \
-i
-d '{"service":{"PKey":"<PKEY>"}}'

```

It returns the updated profile with the service node completed.

```

{
  ...
