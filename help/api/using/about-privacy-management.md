# About privacy management {#about-privacy-management}

Campaign Standard APIs provides features that allow the automatic process of requests related to privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

The actions you can perform are as follows:

* Create a new privacy request,
* Monitor a privacy request,
* Retrieve a privacy data file,
* Manage a profile's CCPA opt-out status.

The privacy API endpoint is **/privacy/privacyTool**. PrivacyTool resource description and associated filters are available in the resource metadata. See [Metadata Mechanism](../../api/using/metadata-mechanism.md).

CCPA opt-out is managed using the **ccpaOptOut** profile attribute.

For more on Adobe Campaign Standard and privacy compliance, refer to the [dedicated documentation](../../start/using/privacy-requests.md).
