# About organizational units {#about-organizational-units}

The **orgUnitBase** endpoint lets you interact with Organizational units, enabling you, for example, to update their attributes or update a profile's Organizational unit. For more on Organizational units in Campaign, refer to the [Campaign documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/administrating/users-and-security/organizational-units.html#administrating).

The **Organizational unit** field is added to a profile when extending the profile resource. As a result, remember to always use the **profileAndServicesExt** endpoint to interact with Geographical units. For more on the profile's resource extension, refer to the [Campaign documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/administrating/users-and-security/organizational-units.html#partitioning-profiles).
