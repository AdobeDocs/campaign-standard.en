The actions that are common to one or more marketing activities are presented in the following sections:

* For more on personalizing an SMS or push notification content, see [Inserting a personalization field](../../designing/using/personalization.md#inserting-a-personalization-field) and [Adding a content block](../../designing/using/personalization.md#adding-a-content-block).
* For more on defining conditional text in an SMS message or push notification, see [Defining dynamic text](../../channels/using/defining-dynamic-text.md).
