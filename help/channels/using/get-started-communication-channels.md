Then, deliver timely and relevant campaigns that meet your customers in the right places and right ways along their customer journey.

**Leverage Campaign message dashboard** to configure and send your messages from one single location, as well as access various functionalities like scheduling, multilingual messaging...

**Manage templates** to configure messages properties and allow you to gain time and consistency across your messaging strategy. As an example, for emails, the functional administrator in charge of configuring the templates can define the standard parameters of an email, such as the audience, schedule, or content, the advanced parameters related to sending, validity, tracking, etc, or the pre-configuration parameters concerning targeting and personalization (targeting context).
