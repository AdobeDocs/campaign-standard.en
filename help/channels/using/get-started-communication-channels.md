Adobe Campaign allows you to launch, measure, and automate campaigns across every channel.
Harmonizing all of your marketing channels is not an impossible task. With the help of Adobe Campaign, you can bring customer data from different systems, devices, and channels into a single profile. Then, deliver timely and relevant campaigns that meet your customers in the right places and right ways along their customer journey.

<img src="assets/do-not-localize/icon_concepts.svg" width="60px">

**Leverage Campaign message dashboard** to configure and send your messages from one single location, as well as access various functionalities like scheduling, multilingual messaging...

**Manage templates** to configure messages properties and allow you to gain time and consistency across your messaging strategy. As an example, for emails, the functional administrator in charge of configuring the templates can define the standard parameters of an email, such as the audience, schedule, or content, the advanced parameters related to sending, validity, tracking, etc, or the pre-configuration parameters concerning targeting and personalization (targeting context).

Campaign comes with landing pages which are web forms that can be used to **capture information on your audiences**, offer subscriptions to a service, display data and grow your database.

Landing pages can also be used for **acquiring or updating existing profiles**, and to set up a double opt-in mechanism, allowing you to to protect the platform from wrong or invalid email addresses, or spambots.
