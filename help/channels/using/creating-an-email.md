# Creating an email{#creating-an-email}

You can create an email from a [campaign](../../start/using/marketing-activities.md#creating-a-marketing-activity), from the Adobe Campaign [home page](../../start/using/interface-description.md#home-page), or in the [marketing activity list](../../start/using/programs-and-campaigns.md#creating-a-campaign). You can also create single-send and recurring emails from a workflow.

1. Once you have started creating an email marketing activity, select the template you would like to use.

   By default, you can choose from several templates for each marketing activity. This allows you to pre-configure certain parameters according to your needs and also assign a brand to your delivery, see the [Managing templates](../../start/using/about-templates.md) section.

   >Follow-up and A/B test templates are hidden by default. Check the boxes on the left side ( **[!UICONTROL Filter]** lateral panel) if you want to display them.

1. Enter the email's general properties. You can enter a name in the **Label** field and edit the ID. Both the activity name and its ID appear in the interface, but they are not visible to the message recipients.

   You can add a description that the user can see in the campaign content.

   >[!NOTE]

   >You can create your email within a parent campaign from the home page or the list of marketing activities. Select it from the campaigns that have already been created.

1. Define the target of your message based on your business criteria, see the [Managing profiles](../../audiences/using/about-profiles.md) section. You also define the test profiles who will validate the message, see the [Managing test profiles](../../sending/using/managing-test-profiles-and-sending-proofs.md#managing-test-profiles) section.

1. Define and personalize the message content, sender name and subject. See the [About email content design](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md) section.

   Then preview your message. See the [Previewing messages](../../sending/using/previewing-messages.md) section.

   You can design your message directly using a pre-defined content template or by using DreamWeaver or Adobe Experience Manager. If you don't feel like a designer, you can also upload a content that has been prepared for you, or import an existing content from a URL. See the [Loading an existing content](../../designing/using/selecting-an-existing-content.md) section.

1. Confirm creating the email. The email dashboard is then displayed, see [Approving messages](../../sending/using/preparing-the-send.md) section.

1. Schedule the sending, see the [Scheduling messages](../../sending/using/about-scheduling-messages.md) guide.

1. Prepare your message to analyze its target, see the [Preparing the send](../../sending/using/confirming-the-send.md) section.

   >You can set global cross-channel fatigue rules that will automatically exclude oversollicited profiles from campaigns. See [Fatigue rules](../../administration/using/fatigue-rules.md).

1. Send proofs to check and validate your message and monitor its inbox rendering, see the [Sending proof](../../sending/using/managing-test-profiles-and-sending-proofs.md#sending-proofs) section.

1. Send the message and check its delivery through the message dashboard and logs, see the [Sending messages](../../sending/using/confirming-the-send.md) section.

1. Measure the impact of your message with delivery reports. For more on reporting, refer to [this section](../../reporting/using/about-dynamic-reports.md).
