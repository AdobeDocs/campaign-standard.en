  <p>You can create and manage personalized transactional messages in Adobe Campaign.</p> 
  <p>A transactional message is an individual and unique communication sent to a user by a provider such as a website.</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><p>This type of message is particularly expected, as it contains information that the recipient wants to check or confirm. It could be a welcome message after creating an account for example, or a confirmation that an order has shipped, a bill, or a message confirming a password change.</p> </li>
   <li><p>It is an important message that defines the client relation: the user expects it to be sent in real time. The delay between the event being triggered and the message arriving therefore has to be very short.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Transactional messages generally have high open rates.</p> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Adobe Campaign allows you to integrate this functionality with an information system which sends it events that are to be transformed into custom transactional messages.</p> 
  <note>
   <p> Transactional messages can be sent by email, SMS or push notification, depending on your options. Please check your license agreement. </p> 
  </note>
  <p>Two types of transactional messages are available in Adobe Campaign:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><p><strong>Event transactional messages</strong> targeting an event. The data contained in the event itself is used to define the delivery target.</p> </li>
   <li><p><strong>Profile transactional messages</strong> targeting profiles from the Adobe Campaign marketing database. You can use information from the Adobe Campaign database to send a transactional message based on customer marketing profiles.</p> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The message type is defined when configuring the event that will be transformed into a transactional message. See <a href="../../administration/using/configuring-transactional-messaging.md">Transactional messaging configuration</a>.</p> 
  <note>
   <p> Adobe Campaign prioritizes processing the transactional messages over any other delivery. </p>

  <h2>Transactional messaging operating principle</h2>
  <p>Let's take the example of a company that has a website and on this website its users can buy products.</p> 
  <p>Adobe Campaign allows you to send a notification email to site users who have added products to their cart: when one of them leaves the site without going through with their purchases, a cart abandonment email is automatically sent to them.</p> 
  <p>The steps for putting this into place are:</p> 
  <ol>
   <li><p>Configure an event that will be named "Cart abandonment" and publishing this event configuration, which automatically creates a transactional message. Creating and publishing an event are presented in the <a href="../../administration/using/configuring-transactional-messaging.md#use-case--configuring-an-event-to-send-a-transactional-message">Configuring an event to send an event transactional message</a> section.</p> </li>
   <li><p>The transactional message has to be personalized, tested, then published. See <a href="../../channels/using/event-transactional-messages.md" target="_blank">Event transactional messages</a>.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Furthermore, in order for the event to be triggered when a client abandons their cart, this event has to be sent from the company's website using the Adobe Campaign Standard REST API. See <a href="../../administration/using/configuring-transactional-messaging.md#integrating-the-triggering-of-the-event-in-a-website">Site integration</a>.</p> </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once all of these steps have been carried out, as soon as a user leaves the site without ordering the products in their cart, they automatically receive a notification email.</p>
