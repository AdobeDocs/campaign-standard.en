# About emails{#about-emails}

The email channel is one of the core channels in Adobe Campaign, allowing you to schedule and send personalized emails to specific targets.

You can send different types of emails:

* Single-send emails: basic emails that you can send once to a defined target.
* Recurring emails: send the same email regularly and aggregate each send and its reports on a periodic basis. A common example is a birthday email. Recurring emails are available through workflows only.
* A/B testing emails: test up to 3 versions of an email.
* Transactional emails: unitary emails that are triggered based on your customers' behavior.

To learn the best practices when creating and sending emails, consult the [Delivery best practices](../../sending/using/delivery-best-practices.md) section.
