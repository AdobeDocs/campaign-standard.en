# Message dashboard{#message-dashboard}

The message dashboard is a workspace made up of different icons - regrouped into an action bar - and various functional blocks that allow you to establish your message's parameters and send it. These elements are presented hereafter.

Depending on the parameters that have been set up and the progress made, certain icons may not be available.

* **[!UICONTROL Show proofs]** : shows/hides the list of proofs that have been sent, if they exist. This button is only enabled once you have sent proofs.

  For more on proofs, see [Managing test profiles and sending proofs](../../sending/using/managing-test-profiles-and-sending-proofs.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Send a test]** : lets you select the approval mode to use: **[!UICONTROL Email rendering]**, **[!UICONTROL Proof]** or both for an email. For more on test profiles, see [Sending proofs](../../sending/using/managing-test-profiles-and-sending-proofs.md#sending-proofs).

  This button is only enabled once you have established test profiles.

  >[!NOTE]

  >For an SMS message, there is no other choice: it is automatically a **[!UICONTROL Proof]**.

* **[!UICONTROL Prepare send]** : starts to prepare the send. The **[!UICONTROL Deployment]** block appears and displays the result of the preparation. This button only appears once the target has been entered. You can stop preparation at any time using the corresponding button.

  For more on message preparation, [Preparing the send](../../sending/using/preparing-the-send.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Confirm send]** : confirms sending the message. The sending statistics appear in the **[!UICONTROL Deployment]** block. This button only appears after the send has been prepared. You can stop or pause the send at any time using the **Stop send** and **[!UICONTROL Pause]** buttons.

  For more on confirming sending, see [Sending messages](../../sending/using/confirming-the-send.md).
