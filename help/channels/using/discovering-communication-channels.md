# Discovering communication channels{#discovering-communication-channels}

Adobe Campaign allows you to launch, measure, and automate campaigns across every channel.
Harmonizing all of your marketing channels is not an impossible task. With the help of Adobe Campaign, you can bring customer data from different systems, devices, and channels into a single profile. Then, deliver timely and relevant campaigns that meet your customers in the right places and right ways along their customer journey.

Five communication channels are available in Adobe Campaign:

* Email, presented in the [Creating an email](../../channels/using/about-emails.md) section.
* SMS, presented in the [Creating an SMS message](../../channels/using/about-sms-messages.md) section.
* Push notification, presented in the [Creating a push notification](../../channels/using/about-push-notifications.md) section.
* In-App messages, presented in the [Creating an In-App message](../../channels/using/about-in-app-messaging.md) section.
* Direct mail, presented in the [Creating a direct mail delivery](../../channels/using/about-direct-mail.md) section.

All marketing activities are based on a [template](../../start/using/marketing-activity-templates.md). Templates can be used to configure properties  and allow you to gain time and consistency across your messaging strategy.

As an example, for emails,  the functional administrator in charge of configuring the templates can define:

* The standard parameters of an email, such as the audience, schedule, or content.
* The advanced parameters related to sending, validity, tracking, etc.
* The pre-configuration parameters concerning targeting and personalization (targeting context).
