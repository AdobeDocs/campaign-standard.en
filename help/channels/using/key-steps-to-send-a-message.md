# Key steps to send a message{#key-steps-to-send-a-message}

To learn the delivery best practices, consult the [Delivery best practices](../../sending/using/delivery-best-practices.md) section.

The steps to create and send messages are as follows:

1. Create an **[!UICONTROL Email]**, a **[!UICONTROL SMS]**, a **[!UICONTROL direct mail]** or a **[!UICONTROL push notification]** marketing activity. Refer to [Creating an email](../../channels/using/creating-an-email.md), [Creating a SMS](../../channels/using/creating-an-sms-message.md), [Creating a direct mail delivery](../../channels/using/creating-the-direct-mail.md) and [Creating a push notification](../../channels/using/preparing-and-sending-a-push-notification.md).
1. Select the audiences of your message. Refer to [Creating audiences](../../audiences/using/creating-audiences.md).
1. Define the message content and its personalization elements. Refer to the [content editor](../../designing/using/designing-content-in-adobe-campaign.md) for email or specific content for other channels.
1. Start preparing the send to calculate the target population and generate the message contents. Refer to [Approving messages](../../sending/using/preparing-the-send.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can set global cross-channel fatigue rules that will automatically exclude oversollicited profiles from campaigns. See [Fatigue rules](../../sending/using/fatigue-rules.md).

1. Send proofs. Refer to [Sending proofs](../../sending/using/sending-proofs.md).
1. Send the message and check its delivery. Refer to [Sending messages](../../sending/using/confirming-the-send.md).
1. Check the dedicated delivery reports. Refer to [Accessing reports](../../reporting/using/about-dynamic-reports.md).

Advanced message parameters are detailed in the [Configuring channels](../../administration/using/about-channel-configuration.md) sections.
