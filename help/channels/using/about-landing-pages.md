About landing pages

Campaign comes with landing pages which are online forms that can be used to capture information on your audiences, offer subscriptions to a service, display data and grow your database. Landing pages can also be used for acquiring or updating existing profiles.

Campaign comes with out-of-box landing page templates:

* **[!UICONTROL Acquisition]** : this is the default template for landing pages, which enables you to capture and update data in Campaign database.
* **[!UICONTROL Subscription]** : this template should be used to offer subscriptions to a service.
* **[!UICONTROL Unsubscription]** : this template can be linked from an email sent to subscribers to a service, to allow them to unsubscribe this service.
* **[!UICONTROL Blacklist]** : this template should be used when a profile no longer wants to be contacted by Campaign (see [About opt-in and opt-out in Campaign](../../audiences/using/about-opt-in-and-opt-out-in-campaign.md)).

These templates are proposed by default when creating a new landing page. They can be customized and you can also create new ones.

The full life cycle of a landing page is as follows:

1. Creation: design and set the content of the landing page.
1. Test: simulate the landing page execution on a test profile.
1. Publication: publish the landing page to push it live.
1. Expiration or depublication: unpublish manually or wait for the landing page to expire, then it is no longer available.

Once created and published, you can make the landing page accessible via a website or by [inserting a direct link to the landing page into an email](../../designing/using/inserting-a-link.md).
