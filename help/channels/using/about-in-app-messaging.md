About In-App messaging

In-App messaging is a messaging channel that allows you to display a message when the user is active within the mobile application. This message type is complimentary to push notifications which are delivered to the notification center of users' phone. For more information on the push notification channel, refer to this [section](../../channels/using/about-push-notifications.md).

This channel requires mobile applications to be integrated with Adobe Experience Platform SDK. These apps have to be activated in Adobe Launch before being available in Adobe Campaign for In-App deliveries.

To start sending In-App messages on mobile applications leveraging Experience Platform SDK, you need to meet following prerequisites:

1. In Adobe Campaign, make sure you can access the **[!UICONTROL In-App]** channel. If you cannot access these channels, contact your account team.
1. In Adobe Launch, create the mobile application by creating a mobile property and instrument your mobile app with Experience Platform SDK.

   For more information, refer to the [Set up a mobile property](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/create-a-mobile-property) section in Adobe Launch documentation.

1. In Adobe Launch, install the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign Standard]** extension for your mobile application in Adobe Launch:

   For more on extensions, refer to the [Configure Campaign Standard Extension in Launch](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-campaign-standard-beta) in Adobe Launch documentation.

To learn how to configure Experience Platform SDKs, refer to this [page](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/configuring-app-sdk.html).
