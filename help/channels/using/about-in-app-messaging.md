>This feature is optional and currently a Beta feature which can be subject to future changes. Please check your license agreement and contact your account executive to activate it. In-App Messaging enables Campaign Customers to serve personalized messages to enhance a user’s In-App experience. Adobe’s Mobile SDK utilizes Marketing Cloud IDs to retrieve data for from Adobe Servers for personalization which may include personal information as directed by Customer. Customer is responsible for securing the mobile application where In-App messaging will be used and to prevent any unauthorized access of user’s data by a third party.

In-App messaging allows you to display a message when the user is active within the mobile application. This message type is complimentary to push notifications which deliver messages directly to the user's phone. For more information on the push notification channel, refer to this [section](../../channels/using/creating-and-sending-a-push-notification.md).

You can now target your application subscribers and send a message within your application with Adobe Campaign.

Three types of In-App message are available in Adobe Campaign:

* **Send In-App message to Campaign profiles**: This message type enables you to target Adobe Campaign profiles who have subscribed to your mobile application and to personalize In-App messages with profile attributes available in Campaign.
* **Broadcast an In-App message**: This message type enables you to send a message to all users of your mobile application even if they don't have an existing profile in Campaign.
* **Send In-App message to app subscribers**: This message type enables you to target all users of a mobile app that have a profile in Campaign whether known or unknown and to personalize In-App messages with any profile attributes that have been obtained from mobile device.
