# Transactional event triggering {#transactional-event-triggering}

Once you have created an event, you need to integrate the triggering of this event into your website.

In the example described in the [Transactional messaging operating principle](../../channels/using/getting-started-with-transactional-msg.md#transactional-messaging-operating-principle) section, you want a "Cart abandonment" event to be triggered whenever one of your clients leaves your website before purchasing the products in their cart.

To do this, your website web developer must use the **Adobe Campaign Standard REST API**.

For more on using the Campaign REST API to manage transactional messages, see the [REST API documentation](../../api/using/managing-transactional-messages.md).
