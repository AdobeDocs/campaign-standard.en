* **[!UICONTROL In progress]** (blue): the message is being sent.
* **[!UICONTROL Finished]** (green): sending has finished without any errors.
* **[!UICONTROL Erroneous]** (red): sending was canceled or an error has occurred while the message was being prepared or sent.

  >A yellow notification banner may appear above the card when an action is required, for example when you have to confirm sending a message.
