About templates

## Marketing activity templates {#marketing-activity-templates}

When you create a new marketing activity, the first screen in the wizard asks you to select a type, or template. Using this template allows you to pre-configure certain parameters according to your needs. The template may contain a full or partial configuration of the marketing activity. The template management is performed by the functional administrator.

The end user has a simplified interface. When creating a new marketing activity, you just need to select the template you would like to use. There is no need to worry about any technical configurations. This has already been pre-configured by the functional administrator in the template.

For example, in the case of an email template, you can pre-fill the HTML content, the audience, and any other parameter of your delivery: schedule, test profiles, your delivery's general properties, the advanced parameters, etc. This allows you to save time when creating a new activity.

For each type of marketing activity, one or several out-of-the-box templates are available. They offer minimal configuration for each type of marketing activity. These out-of-the-box templates cannot be modified or deleted.

Templates are available for the following marketing activities:

* Programs
* Campaigns
* Email deliveries
* SMS deliveries
* Push notifications
* Landing pages
* Workflows
* Services
* Import
* Transactional messages

These templates are managed from the **Resources** > **Templates** screen.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Brand configuration can be pre-configured in an email or landing page template. For more information, refer to the [Branding](../../administration/using/branding.md) section.

## Content templates {#content-templates}

You can also manage HTML contents that will be offered in the email content editing screen.

These templates include 18 mobile-optimized layouts corresponding to the most current usages such as customer welcome, newsletters and reengagement emails, among others. They can easily be customized with your brandsâ€™ content to ease the process of designing emails from scratch.

These out-of-the-box HTML contents are managed from the **Resources** > **Content templates** screen. They are read-only. To edit one of them, you must first duplicate it. You can also create new templates and define your own contents.

For more information on editing content, refer to the [Design content](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md) section.
