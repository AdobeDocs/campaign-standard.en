# Creating a multilingual template{#creating-a-multilingual-template}

A multilingual template is a specific template to manage multilingual messages.

This kind of template is available for **Email and SMS messages** and useable in standalone mode, within a workflow or in a recurring delivery.

In the multilingual feature templates, the language management is based on variants. **Each variant represents one language.**

Adobe Campaign Standard is able to set up a maximum of 40 variants.

Adobe Campaign comes with a default language which is set to EN. The default language could be changed to another variant but should be never deleted.

During the template creation, you can add the number of variants corresponding to the number of needed languages in the message.

To perform the creation of SMS or email template, follow the steps:

1. Duplicate an existing multilingual template (SMS or Email).

You are now ready to create an email or an SMS message based on this multilingual template.
