# Integrating with Adobe solutions{#integrating-with-adobe-solutions}

Integrating with Adobe solutions

Integration with other Adobe Experience Cloud solutions may require you to adapt your initial configuration. Contact your Adobe technical administrator for more information.

If you have other Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, you can integrate them with Adobe Campaign, and then you will be able to:

* Use contents created from Adobe Experience Manager in Adobe Campaign messages.

  For more on this, refer to [Working with Campaign and Experience Manager](../../integrating/using/integrating-with-experience-manager.md).

* Import shared audiences from different Experience Cloud solutions in order to use them in Adobe Campaign, and export Adobe Campaign audiences into Adobe Experience Cloud, so that they can be used in different solutions.

  For more on this, refer to [Working with Campaign and People Core Service](../../integrating/using/about-campaign-audience-manager-or-people-core-service-integration.md).

* Insert dynamic images generated by Adobe Target into your Adobe Campaign messages.

  For more on this, refer to [Working with Campaign and Target](../../integrating/using/about-campaign-target-integration.md).

* Use resources shared from Adobe Experience Cloud in your Adobe Campaign messages and landing pages.

  For more on this, refer to [Working with Campaign and Assets core service](../../integrating/using/working-with-campaign-and-assets-core-service.md).

* Track the success of your email deliveries directly in Adobe Analytics.

  For more on this, refer to [Working with Campaign and Analytics](../../integrating/using/about-campaign-analytics-integration.md).

* Through integration with Adobe Analytics for mobile, use the Points of Interest data collected from your mobile application's subscribers to send them personalized marketing messages.

  For more on this, refer to [Working with Campaign and Analytics for mobile/Points of Interest data](../../integrating/using/about-campaign-points-of-interest-data-integration.md).

* Create and modify the content of your emails in Dreamweaver.

  For more on this refer to [Editing content in Dreamweaver](../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md#editing-content-in-dreamweaver).
