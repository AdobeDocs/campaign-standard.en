With Adobe Campaign, you can monitor and track each delivery individually. The message dashboard displays dedicated logs to follow-up processes, rules and identify possible errors and warnings. For more about delivery monitoring, refer to the [Monitoring a delivery](../../sending/using/monitoring-a-delivery.md) section. Tracking principles and capabilities are presented in the [Tracking messages](../../sending/using/tracking-messages.md) section.
