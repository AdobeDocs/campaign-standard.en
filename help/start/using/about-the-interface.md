# About the interface{#about-the-interface}

Adobe Campaign's user interface is based on concepts which are common to all the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions.

This interface is intended for web browsers. It is completely resizable and therefore automatically adapts to the media on which it is used: desktop computer or tablet. Every element is compatible with the use of a mouse or touchscreen.

Campaign interface, capabilities and options you can access to may vary depending your contract and user permissions. It is available in English, French and German.

Please note that language is set up at the installation, and cannot be changed afterwards.

In order to adapt to the different uses and new functionalities offered, the Adobe Campaign user interface and all of its elements are updated regularly. You may notice some differences between the version that you are using and the screens shown in this document.

The navigation principles are common to all of these solutions.

Key steps to create and orchestrate a marketing campaign with Adobe Campaign are:

* **Preparing** - This initial phase allows the user to formalize the need, intention, and objective of the campaign: creating the marketing plan, identifying the target, defining the content and creation mode, expected results, and people involved.
* **Targeting** - The targeting phase allows the user to define the data collection mode, their structure, their segmentation, audiences, seeds and tests, filtering conditions to design, etc. During this phase, you can also set up subscription/unsubscription methods. See [Profiles and audiences](../../audiences/using/about-profiles.md).
* **Creating messages and content** - This phase involves selecting the [communication channel](../../channels/using/discovering-communication-channels.md). You can also design [landing pages](../../channels/using/getting-started-with-landing-pages.md) to acquire or update profiles, and grow your database. See [Creating an email](../../channels/using/creating-an-email.md), [Creating an SMS message](../../channels/using/creating-an-sms-message.md), [Creating a push notification](../../channels/using/preparing-and-sending-a-push-notification.md), [Creating an InApp message](../../channels/using/about-in-app-messaging.md), [Creating a direct mail delivery](../../channels/using/creating-the-direct-mail.md).
* **Testing and sending** - The execution phase allows the user to carry out the various validation steps (content, target) particularly via preview screens and by sending a proof to the approvers, before sending. See [Testing and sending](../../sending/using/about-sending-messages-with-campaign.md).
* **Monitoring and reporting** - Once the campaign has been executed and the different messages have been sent, this stage allows the user to collect the different statuses of the sends, and the tracking and monitoring information. The campaign and delivery reports are generated to track the impact of the campaign and the recipients' activities. See [Reporting tools](../../reporting/using/about-dynamic-reports.md).
* **Automating** - During this stage, additional factors such as the import/export mechanism implementation methods, the data management and update modes, personalization data identification, etc. are defined. See [Workflows and data management](../../automating/using/workflow-data-and-processes.md).
