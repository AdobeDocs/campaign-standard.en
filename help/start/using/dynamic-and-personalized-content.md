# Dynamic and personalized content{#dynamic-and-personalized-content}

Get your clients' attention and improve your response rate by using content and headers that are personalized according to their profiles, their preferences, and their activity. All of your client information is centralized in Adobe Campaign and you can offer messages containing adapted content, via different channels.

Personalized messages are key to send relevant content, offer personalized experiences and increase open and conversion rates. Cross-channel messages delivered by Adobe Campaign can be personalized in several different ways. These ways can be combined with criteria depending on the profiles. You can:

* Insert [dynamic personalization fields](../../designing/using/inserting-a-personalization-field.md) in your messages
* Insert [predefined personalization blocks](../../designing/using/adding-a-content-block.md)
* [Personalize the sender](../../designing/using/personalizing-the-sender.md) of an email or a SMS
* [Personalize the subject line](../../designing/using/personalizing-the-subject-line-of-an-email.md) of an email, or use [Predictive subject line](../../designing/using/personalizing-the-subject-line-of-an-email.md#predictive-subject-line) capabilities to optimize it
* Create [conditional content in an email](../../designing/using/defining-dynamic-content-in-an-email.md) or [in a landing page](../../designing/using/defining-dynamic-content-in-a-landing-page.md)
* Insert [Dynamic text](../../designing/using/defining-dynamic-text.md) in a SMS message or a Push notification
