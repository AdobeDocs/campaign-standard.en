  <p>Key steps to create and orchestrate a marketing campaign with Adobe Campaign are:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><p><strong>Preparing</strong> - This initial phase allows the user to formalize the need, intention, and objective of the campaign: creating the marketing plan, identifying the target, defining the content and creation mode, expected results, and people involved.</p> </li>
   <li><p><strong>Targeting</strong> - The targeting phase allows the user to define the data collection mode, their structure, their segmentation, audiences, seeds and tests, filtering conditions to design, etc. During this phase, you can also set up subscription/unsubscription methods. See <a href="../../audiences/using/about-profiles.md">About profiles and audiences</a>.</p> </li>
   <li><p><strong>Designing content</strong> - This phase involves creating the delivery/ies, selecting the communication channel, setting up the approval mode. You can also design online pages to acquire or update profiles, and grow your database. See <a href="../../designing/using/about-email-content-design.md">About content designing</a>.</p> </li>
   <li><p><strong>Testing and sending</strong> - The execution phase allows the user to carry out the various validation steps (content, target) particularly via preview screens and by sending a proof to the approvers, before sending. See <a href="../../sending/using/about-sending-messages-with-campaign.md">About testing and sending</a>.</p> </li>
   <li><p><strong>Monitoring and reporting</strong> - Once the campaign has been executed and the different messages have been sent, this stage allows the user to collect the different statuses of the sends, and the tracking and monitoring information. The campaign and delivery reports are generated to track the impact of the campaign and the recipients' activities. See <a href="../../reporting/using/about-dynamic-reports.md">About reporting</a>.</p> </li>
   <li><p><strong>Automating</strong> - During this stage, additional factors such as the import/export mechanism implementation methods, the data management and update modes, personalization data identification, etc. are defined. See <a href="../../automating/using/about-data-and-processes.md">About workflows and data management</a>.</p> </li>
  </ul>
