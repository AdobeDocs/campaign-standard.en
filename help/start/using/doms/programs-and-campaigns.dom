  <h2>About plans, programs and campaigns</h2>
  <p>Adobe Campaign allows you to plan marketing campaigns in which you can create and manage different types of activities: emails, SMS messages, push notifications, workflows, landing pages. These campaigns and their contents can be gathered into programs.</p> 
  <p>The programs and campaigns allow you to regroup and view the different marketing activities that are linked to them.</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><p>A <strong>program</strong> may contain other programs as well as campaigns, workflows, and landing pages. It appears in the timeline and help you organize your marketing activities: you can separate them by country, by brand, by unit, etc.</p> </li>
   <li><p>A <strong>campaign</strong> enables you to gather all the marketing activities of your choice under a single entity. A campaign may contain emails, SMS, push notifications, direct mails, workflows, and landing pages.</p> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To better organize your marketing plans, Adobe recommends the following hierarchy: Program &gt; Sub-programs &gt; Campaigns &gt; Workflows &gt; Deliveries.</p> 
  <p>Reports on programs and campaigns allow you to analyze their impact. For example, you can build reports at the campaign level to aggregate data on all deliveries contained in that campaign.</p>

  <h2>Programs and campaigns icons and statuses</h2>
  <p>Each program and each campaign in the list has a visual symbol and an icon whose color indicates the execution status. This status depends on the validity period of the program or the campaign.</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><p>Gray: the program/campaign has not yet started - <strong>Editing</strong> status.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Blue: the program/campaign is in progress - <strong>In progress</strong> status.</p> </li>
   <li><p>Green: the program/campaign has finished - <strong>Finished</strong> status. By default, the current date is automatically shown as the validity start date and the end date is calculated according to the start date (<strong>D+186 days</strong>). You can change these dates in the program or campaign properties.</p> </li>
