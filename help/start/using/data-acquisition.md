Data acquisition

Profiles are individual contacts are centralized in the Adobe Campaign database. Various mechanisms for profile acquisition and creating this database can be used: collecting data online via [landing pages](../../channels/using/about-landing-pages.md), manual or [automated import mechanisms](../../automating/using/about-data-import-and-export.md), [direct input](../../audiences/using/creating-profiles.md) in the Adobe Campaign interface, bulk creation through [Campaign APIs](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/en/api/ACS_API.html).

Profiles creation and management are detailed in the [About profiles](../../audiences/using/about-profiles.md) section.
