# Accessibility in Email Designer {#accessibility-email-designer}

Accessibility refers to making products usable for people with visual, auditory, motor, and other disabilities.

Examples of accessibility features for software products include contextual help, content assistant, support for screen readers and so on.

## Navigate Workspace using the keyboard

However, the email designer does not fully support keyboard accessibility
CTRL + Z = Undo
CTRL + Y = Redo

## Create responsive resize for multiple devices

When designing for multiple devices and platforms, it's important to create a seamless experience for screen sizes across mobile and desktop resolutions. 

Work in your preferred language

## Contextual help

Description of the feature + doc link

## Content Assistant

When building a component, required fields are validated when you save. If a required field does not pass validation, it will be outlined in red with an error icon. A written description appears of the issue that needs to be fixed.

Once a component is fully validated, pressing Save closes the builder.

## Support for screen magnifiers

A screen reader reads text that appears on the computer screen. It also reads non-textual information, such as button labels or image descriptions in the application, provided in accessibility tags or attributes.

## Alternative texts for image buttons

The Alt text attribute lets you create alternate text that can be read in lieu of viewing an illustration.

## Work in your preferred language

It is available in English, French and German.

Please note that language is set up at the installation, and cannot be changed afterwards.
