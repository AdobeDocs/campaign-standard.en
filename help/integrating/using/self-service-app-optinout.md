# Opt in/out Workflow

* Tables
  - has to be contacts and profile
* Discuss the synchronization directions
  - Unidirectional D365-to-ACS should just use ingress
  - Discuss how data flow from ACS to D365 is just once a day
* Mappings
  - only boolean values on the D365 side
  - fixed selection of values from ACS
