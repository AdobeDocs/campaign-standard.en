# User Interface General Usage

There is a separate help page for each of the screens in the integration application UI. Each of these help pages will describe how to use each screen and how the settings will effect the integration logic.   This help page, however, will give you a high level description of general usage and navigation within the UI.

## Header

The header within the self-service app allows you define which org and instance you are currently viewing and/or configuring.

The Org in the header allows you to choose which of the Experience Cloud organizations you want to view/edit. It appears read-only; however, it becomes editable when you put your mouse cursor over it.

The Instance in the header allows you to choose which of the Adobe Campaign instances you want to view/edit.   It appears read-only; however, it becomes editable when you put your mouse cursor over it.

A dropdown menu will be displayed when you click the button with the three horizontal lines (a.k.a hamburger) on the 
right hand side of the header (it looks like this: ![](assets/d365-to-acs-icon-hamburger.png))
 
The entries in the dropdown menu are 
 
* Settings
  
  Selecting this option will send you to a screen that allows you to specify API credentials for Dynamics 365 and Adobe Campaign,
  as well as other general settings for the application.
   
* Documentation

  This option is a link to the Adobe Campaign Documentation specific to this integration

* Customer Care

  This is a link to Experience Cloud documentation related to opening a Customer Care ticket 

* Sign out

  This will sign you out of the application and allow you to sign back in as another user.  

* About

  This displays a dialog that contains information about the application, including copyright information.

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs appear at the top of some screens as you navigate the app.

**Example:**

Below is an example from the "Edit Table Mapping" screen that is showing the breadcrumbs and the page title. In this case, you can click on the "Workflows" or "Dynamics 365 to Campaign" text to go to one of the previous screens. "Edit Table Mapping" in the breadcrumbs isn't clickable in this case because it's the current screen.
