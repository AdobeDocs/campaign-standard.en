# User Interface General Usage

There is a separate help page for each of the pages in the Dynamics 365 / Campaign Integration application.   Each of 
these will describe how to use each page and how the settings will effect the integration logic.   This page, however,
will give you a high level description of general usage and navigation within the Adobe Campaign Standard integration 
with Dynamics 365 self-service app.

### Header

The header within the self-service app allows you define which org and instance you are currently viewing and/or 
configuring.

The Org in the header allows you to choose which of the Experience Cloud organizations you want to view/edit.   It looks
read only, however, when you put the mouse cursor over it then it becomes editable.

The Instance in the header allows you to choose which of the Adobe Campaign instances you want to view/edit.   It looks
read only, however, when you put the mouse cursor over it then it becomes editable.

A dropdown menu will be displayed when you click the button with the three horizontal lines (a.k.a hamburger) on the 
right hand side of the header (it looks like this: ![](assets/d365-to-acs-icon-hamburger.png))

### Breadbrumbs

Breadcrumbs appear at the top of some of the pages as you click into the pages.

**Example:**

Below is an example from the "Edit Table Mapping" page that is showing the breadcrumbs and the page title.   In this 
case, you can click on the "Workflows" or "Dynamics 365 to Campaign" text to go to one of the previous pages.    "Edit
Table Mapping" in the breadcrumbs isn't clickable in this case because it's the current page.
