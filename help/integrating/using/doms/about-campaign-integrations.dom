  <p>This section details the functional integrations available between the current version of Adobe Campaign and Adobe clouds as well as its solutions.</p> 
  <p>The different integrations presented below allow you to combine the delivery functionalities and advanced campaign management functionalities of Adobe Campaign with a set of solutions created to help you personalize your users' experience.</p> 
  <p>By default, Adobe Campaign is already linked to an Adobe Experience Cloud account.</p> 
  <p>Depending on your environment, other solutions can also be linked to Adobe Experience Cloud. They are linked as Organizations (also called Tenants). </p> 
  <p>An organization is the entity that enables an administrator to configure groups and users, and to control single sign-on in the Experience Cloud. The organization functions like a log-in company that spans all the Experience Cloud products and solutions. Most often, an organization is your company name. However, a company can have many organizations. User and organization management is detailed in the <a href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/organizations.html">Adobe Experience Cloud help portal</a>.</p> 
  <p>If you would like to integrate data flows from other systems with Adobe Campaign, have a look at our <a href="https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/en/api/ACS_API.html">API documentation</a>.</p>
