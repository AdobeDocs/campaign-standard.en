# Campaign dimensions in Analytics

Campaign dimensions in Analytics

Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics integration lets you track the success of your email deliveries directly in Adobe Analytics.

Campaign dimensions found in Analytics are listed below:

<table> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th> Dimension<br /> </th> 
   <th> Definition<br /> </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Campaign ID<br /> </td> 
   <td> Campaign's internal name as seen in Campaign<br /> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Campaign label<br /> </td> 
   <td> Campaign's label as seen in Campaign<br /> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Delivery ID<br /> </td> 
   <td> Delivery's internal name as seen in Campaign.<br /> For example, DM1 is a recurring delivery scheduled to send child deliveries every week. DM2, DM3 and DM4 are sent the first three weeks. The Delivery ID dimension will then display the results for every delivery, namely DM1 to DM4. <br /> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Delivery label<br /> </td> 
   <td> Delivery's label as seen in Campaign<br /> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Executed delivery ID<br /> </td> 
   <td> Delivery's internal name as seen in Campaign. This only concerns delivery in execution in Campaign.<br /> For example, DM1 is a recurring delivery scheduled to send child deliveries every week. DM2, DM3 and DM4 are sent the first three weeks. The Executed delivery ID dimension will then display the results for the executed deliveries, namely the child deliveries DM2, DM3 and DM4. <br /> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> Executed delivery label<br /> </td> 
   <td> Delivery's label as seen in Campaign. This only concerns delivery in execution in Campaign.<br /> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
