About Campaign-Target integration

Integration between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Target (Classic and Standard) within Adobe Experience Cloud allows you to insert a dynamic image from Adobe Target into an Adobe Campaign email delivery.

This integration allows recipient to receive email sent via Adobe Campaign including a dynamic version of the content thanks to Adobe Target. This dynamic version is computed depending on the rules specified beforehand when creating the email.

Several types of data can be used by Adobe Target:

* Data from the Adobe Campaign datamart
* Segments linked to the visitor ID in Adobe Target, if the data used is not subject to legal limitations
* Adobe Target data: user agent, IP address, geolocalization data

For more information on the integration between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Target, you can also refer to the [Adobe Target Portal](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/a4t/c_campaign_and_target.html).
