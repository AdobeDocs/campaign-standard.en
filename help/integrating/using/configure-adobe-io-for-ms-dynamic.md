# Configure Adobe IO for Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration

Activate your CRM data on cross-channel communication: learn steps required during pre-integration setup to create a new Adobe IO project and configure it for the Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration.

## Overview

Adobe Campaign Standard - Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration is described in [this page](../../integrating/using/working-with-campaign-standard-and-microsoft-dynamics-365.md).

Before performing the pre-integration setup in this article, it is assumed that you have already been provisioned and have admin access to your organizationâ€™s Campaign Standard instance.  If this has not happened, then you will need to get in contact with Adobe Customer Care to complete Campaign provisioning.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Steps described below need to be performed by an administrator.

## Configuration

You will need to create a new Adobe IO project and configure it for the integration. 

### Create a new project

To achieve this, follow the procedure below:

1. Navigate to [Adobe IO Console](https://console.adobe.io/home#) and select your Adobe IMS Organization ID from the drop-down menu at the top right of the screen.

1. Then click on **[!UICONTROL Create new project]** under **[!UICONTROL Quick Start]**.

1. On the next screen you will have the option to upload your own public key or let Adobe IO generate the key pair for you. These instructions will follow the latter option. If you decide to let Adobe IO generate the key pair, click on option 1; then click on "Generate keypair" button.

1. On the next screen you will be prompted to name and select the download location of the key pair zip file.

Once downloaded, you can unzip the file to reveal the public and private keys. Adobe IO has already applied the public key to your Adobe IO project. You will need to retain your private key for later; the private key will be used during the pre-integration setup of the integration tool.

1. Click on "Next" to continue
