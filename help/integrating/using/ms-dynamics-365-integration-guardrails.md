# Guardrails and Integration Boundaries

## Integration Guardrails

The following guardrails should be taken into consideration when planning to use this integration. Consult with your Adobe technical representative if you believe you exceed these guardrails; in some cases these can be relaxed.

* **Engine calls** - You will need to have the proper Campaign package to support the ACS engine call volume generated by the integration. Exceeding the licensed engine call volume could cause a degradation in Campaign performance.

    Use the following to help estimate the engine call volume from the integration:

    * Record inserts (i.e., new record): 1 engine call
    * Record deletes: 1 engine call
    * Record updates: 2 engine calls

    When estimating overall ACS engine call volume, it is important to factor in other sources of engine calls, including landing pages, WebApps, JSSP, APIs, mobile app registrations, etc.

* **Max contact volume** - The integration supports a maximum of 30 million contacts.

* **Max custom entities** - The integration supports a maximum of 5 custom entities; additional entities may cost extra (paid for separately)

* **Custom entity volume** - Custom entities over 500k records will require extra hours to perform a one-time initial file-based import via Campaign workflow (paid for separately)

* **Max column count** - The integration supports a maximum of 50 columns per custom entity.

* **Max table depth** - The integration supports a max table depth of 2 when linking tables (i.e., table1->table2->table3)

* **Data Types** - Only primitive data types are supported (i.e., integer, string, etc.).  Table lookups will not be supported. Dynamics 365 data types will all get converted to a string before getting passed to Campaign.

## Integration boundaries

The integration does not support the following:

* Syncing contact and custom entity records from Campaign to Dynamics 365 (excluding opt-out)
* Composing and trigging Campaign emails from within Dynamics 365
* Managing Campaign subscriptions/unsubscribes
* Remodeling data between the Dynamics 365 and Campaign data models (i.e., this should be 1:1 table sync)
* Issuing privacy requests (e.g., GDPR delete requests) between systems
* Solving every custom use case; the connector was designed to solve common data movement use cases between D365 and ACS for a wide variety of customers

Other important notices:

* Integration support is currently 24/5 (24-hours, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays), unless there is as a system-wide issue, which will be covered 24/7
* There is no self-service user interface for now; this will be coming later in the year. Until then, you will be able to provide configuration details directly to the integration onboarding team
* Maintenance windows will need to be established for the initial data transfer as the larger volumes may cause slowdowns
* You are encouraged to communicate known instances of significant increase or “spikes” in integration usage (e.g., sharp increase in new or updated records), as this could cause slowdowns in data syncing
