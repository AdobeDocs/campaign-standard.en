# About Campaign and Dynamics integration{#about-campaign-and-dynamics-integration}

(1) Contact data from Dynamics will be ingested to Campaign by Unifi's mapping engine - we call it "ingress process"

(2) delivery will be created, user will open / click the email. And based on the tracking data collected in Campaign, experience data will be sent to Dynamics, so that Dynamics can display those event as each user's timeline card - we call this "egress process"
