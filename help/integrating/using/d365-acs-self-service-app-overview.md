# Integration Self-Service Application Overview

The Adobe Campaign Standard integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 self-service integration application gives you the ability to configure data flows, control whether or not they are running, and in which environment. You must, however, complete some prerequisites before you begin using the self-service integration application.

## Concepts and Restrictions {#concepts-and-restrictions}

The first step is to understand the concepts and guardrails associated with the integration and take some initial steps to gain access. These topics are addressed on the following pages:

* [Get Started with Dynamics 365 integration](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-get-started.md)
* [Manage data between Campaign and Dynamics 365](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-notices-and-recommendations.md)
* [Request the integration](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-requesting-the-integration.md)
* [Integration guardrails](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-guardrails.md)
* [Use the Dynamics 365 integration](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-using-the-integration.md)

## Access and Initial Setup 

The next step is to configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Adobe Campaign Standard so that the integration application has access to your data. This will take some time to configure in Dynamics 365, Adobe Campaign Standard, and Adobe.io; however, once they are configured, you'll be able to control the integration through the self-service integration application's user interface. The following screens will walk you through enabling and accessing the self-service integration application:

* [Configure Dynamics 365 for Campaign integration](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-configure-d365.md)
* [Configure Adobe I/O](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-configure-adobe-io.md)
* [Map Campaign custom resources and Dynamics 365 custom entities](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-notices-and-recommendations.md)
* [Get Access to the Integration App](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-control-access.md)
* [Quick Start Guide](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-quick-start-guide.md)

## Understanding the User Interface {#understanding-ui}

Once you understand the concepts and guardrails of the integration and have completed the steps to gain access to the self-service integration application, you'll want to review the pages describing the user interface in detail (in these screens):

* [General Usage](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-general-usage.md)
* [Data Flows](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-workflows.md)
    * Microsoft Dynamics 365 to Campaign 
        * [Table Mappings List](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-ingress-list.md)
        * [Editing an Individual Table Mapping](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-ingress-individual-mapping.md)
    * [Campaign to Dynamics 365](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-egress.md)
    * [Opt in/out](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-optinout.md)
* [Settings](../../integrating/using/d365-acs-self-service-app-settings.md)
