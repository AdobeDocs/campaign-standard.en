# Integration Self-Service Application Overview

The Adobe Campaign Standard integration with Dynamics 365 self-service application gives you the ability to configure data flows, control whether or not they are running, and in which environment.   You must, however, complete some pre-requistes before you begin using the self-service application.

## Concepts and Restrictions {#concepts-and-restrictions}

The first step is to understand the concepts and restrictions associated with the integration and take some initial steps to gain access.    These topics are addressed on the following pages:
* [Get Started with Dynamics 365 integration](integrating/using/d365-acs-get-started.md)
* [Manage data between Campaign and Dynamics 365](integrating/using/d365-acs-notices-and-recommendations.md)
* [Request the integration](integrating/using/d365-acs-requesting-the-integration.md)
* [Integration guardrails](integrating/using/d365-acs-guardrails.md)
* [Use the Dynamics 365 integration](integrating/using/d365-acs-using-the-integration.md)  
 
## Access and Initial Setup 
 
The next step is configure Dynamics 365 and Adobe Campaign Standard so that the integration has access to your data.   This till take some to configure in Dynamics 365, Adobe Campaign Standard, and adobe.io, however, once configured then you can control the integration through the self-service application's user interface.  The following pages will walk you through the steps to getting setup to enable and access the self-service application:
* [Configure Dynamics 365 for Campaign integration](integrating/using/d365-acs-configure-d365.md)
* [Configure Adobe I/O](integrating/using/d365-acs-configure-adobe-io.md)
* [Map Campaign custom resources and Dynamics 365 custom entities](integrating/using/d365-acs-map-campaign-custom-resources-and-dynamics-365-custom-entities.md)

## Understanding the User Interface {#understanding-ui}
 
Once you understand the concepts and restrictions of the integration and have completed the steps to gaining access to the self-service
