# Egress Workflow

This page allows you to identify which user events will be mapped from Adobe Campaign to Microsoft Dynamics 365.  By
selection "Yes", you confirm that you do want this data to flow to Dynamics 365.   Conversly, "No" means that that event
will not be communicated to Dynamics 365.

Remember that you need to click "Save" to save your selections.   Also remember that you must stop the "Campaign to 
Dynamics 365"  workflow and then click play for the integration to incorporate your changes.
