# User Interface General Usage

There is a separate help page for each of the pages in the Dynamics 365 / Campaign Integration application.   Each of 
these will describe how to use each page and how the settings will effect the integration logic.   This page, however,
will give you a high level description of general usage and navigation within the self-service app.

### Breadbrumbs

Breadcrumbs appear at the top of some of the pages as you click into the pages.

#### Example

Below is an example from the "Edit Table Mapping" page that is showing the breadcrumbs and the page title.   In this 
case, you can click on the "Workflows" or "Dynamics 365 to Campaign" text to go to one of the previous pages.    "Edit
Table Mapping" in the breadcrumbs isn't clickable in this case because it's the current page.
