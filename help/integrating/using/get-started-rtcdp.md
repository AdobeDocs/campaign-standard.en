# Get started with Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform {#rtcdp}

With Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform, you share data between Campaign Standard and Adobe Experience Platform.

To do this, you first need to connect Adobe Experience Platform **Destinations** and **Sources** to Campaign Standard.

* Destinations allow you to activate audiences from AEP to ACS/ACC using a load file (équivalent audiences)
* Sources: export data from ACS/ACC to AEP using a transfer file (équivalent data mapping)

Once destinations and sources are configured, you need to set up a data import or export into Campaign Standard using workflows.
