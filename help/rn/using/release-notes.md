**Improvements**

* Timezone management has been enhanced. You can now define a specific timezone for an entire workflow. The selected timezone will apply to all the workflow's activities. Information about the timezone that has been configured for the operator or the server is now displayed in the interface (in logs, and after selecting a timezone).

* Campaign Standard APIs now allow you to perform pagination when using large tables, by adding the `_forcePagination=true parameter` to your call URL. [Read more](../../api/using/pagination.md)

* The Delivery log ID (which is a unique identifier for each log) is now available in the Delivery logs and Tracking logs resources for all targeting dimensions. This enables to identify sending or tracking logs when exporting, for example.

**Email Designer enhancements**

* Fixed an issue with containing elements to allow text resize without loss of functionality.
* Fixed an issue with accessibility ensuring that alternative text is available for images.
* Fixed an issue with the auto Calendar pop-up to allow users to dismiss content that appears on hover in marketing activities.
* Fixed an issue with accessibility ensuring that instructive text is placed at the beginning of the Audiences form.
* Fixed an issue when clicking on change content in the wizard of the deprecated content editor.
* Fixed an issue which prevented headers from being aligned with the content on the Service Summary report. (CAMP-38103)

**Other changes**

* The "Deliveries with preparation failed" filter now takes into account the deliveries' creation date rather than the last modification date. 
* Organizational units can no longer be changed for the Administrators security group.
* When creating a profile, the Organizational unit field must now be filled. 
* An Experience Cloud Trigger can now only be deleted if both the event and the transactional template that are linked to it are deleted.

**Patches**

* Fixed an issue in the **[!UICONTROL External API]** activity which displayed the **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** button even when no data was modified.
* Fixed an issue when using an **[!UICONTROL Union]** activity on queries with different target dimensions. The transition data only showed records from the main set's targeting dimension. (CAMP-36831)
* Fixed an issue that could lead to an error when using a **[!UICONTROL Reconciliation]** activity in specific contexts, for example with two inbound activities, one of them being an exclusion activity. (CAMP-37490)
* Fixed performance issues that could occur when selecting and updating test profiles. (CAMP-37976)
* Fixed an issue that could display error pages when subscribing or unsubscribing via landing pages. (CAMP-37771)

* Fixed an error with email bulk deliveries which displayed the deliveries' state as Pending and the Sent status as Finished. (CAMP-35355)
* Fixed an error which displayed the sender domain incorrectly in Dynamic reporting. (CAMP-33123)
