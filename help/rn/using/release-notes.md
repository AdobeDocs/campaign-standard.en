  <td> <p>You can now use <strong>Control groups</strong> to measure the impact of your campaigns by excluding a portion of their audience. You will then be able to compare the behavior of the target population which did receive the message with the behavior of contacts which were not targeted. Based on the sending logs, you can also target a control group in future campaigns.

**Improvements**

* **Privacy Management**: the **CCPA Opt-Out** field, which was available via the Campaign interface and API, is now also supported through the Privacy Core Service. This field allows Adobe Campaign users to track whether a consumer has opted-out for the sale of Personal Information. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign/kb/acs-privacy.html#ccpa)
* **Workflow execution improvements** (beta): in the context of a global initiative around workflows, some major improvements have been developed to stabilize memory management, reduce latency and optimize the memory consumed by workflows during execution. These improvements are currently in beta, and only available to a set of customers. General availability is planned for early 2021.
* To improve security, Campaign now uses a **signature mechanism** for tracking links in emails.
* Mobile app configuration has been improved with **clearer error messages** when uploading iOS certificates or Android keys.
* A **new delivery mapping** (mapRtEventAppSubRcp) is now available for transactional push messages targeting profiles. The delivery, exclusion and tracking logs for these deliveries will now be available in the broadLogAppSubRcp, excludeLogAppSubRcp and trackingLogAppSubRcp tables. This solves an issue which caused delivery analysis to fail when sending a transactional push message using the **Profile** target dimension.
* **SMS error management** has been improved to prevent too many profiles from being added to the quarantine list. By default, SMS errors are now configured as soft errors instead of hard errors. Refer to [this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/sms-connector-protocol-and-settings.html).

**Email Designer enhancements**

* We have improved the user experience in the Email Designer with the **new dynamic contextual help** which fully connects user interface and documentation, providing an easy access to the latest help content.
* Fixed an issue which removed line breaks in a message when editing its text version. (CAMP-44483)
* Fixed an issue which prevented the plain text version of an HTML template from being automatically generated and synchronized. (CAMP-44195)
* Fixed an issue that could occur when resizing images. Once the messages were sent, the images did not display properly in Microsoft Outlook. (CAMP-44656)
* Fixed an issue which occurred when inserting a button and setting its width to "auto". Once the message was sent, the content of the button was not displayed entirely. (CAMP-44560)
* Fixed an issue which occurred when uploading content from an attached HTML file. Once the message was sent to a Gmail address, the CSS was not applied, causing a rendering issue. (CAMP-44085)
* Fixed an issue which prevented content fragments previously used in a message from being updated when they were modified directly in the content template. (CAMP-43973)
* Fixed an issue with the **Fragments** search bar. When searching for an existing fragment, the search bar showed no result. (CAMP-44223)
* Fixed an issue with the **Content Blocks** and **Fragments** search bars. When using one of the search bars, results were only displayed if you clicked **Show More Results...**. (CAMP-44205)
* Fixed an issue which prevented padding between text and images from being applied in Microsoft Outlook. (CAMP-45370)
* Fixed an issue when duplicating a fragment. After duplicating the fragment, the original fragment had missing HTML lines. (CAMP-45207)
* Fixed an error which caused rendering issues in Microsoft Outlook. (CAMP-44749)
* Fixed an error which occurred when modifying the **Structure Component** padding in a delivery template. CSS tags did not carry over changes made to the padding causing a rendering issue. (CAMP-45381)
* Fixed an issue when uploading an image. The image's height was automatically set to 0 causing a rendering issue. (CAMP-45366)

**Other changes**

* Retry mechanisms have been added in case of error when trying to import an Experience Platform audience using a **Read audience** activity. (CAMP-43947, CAMP-43366)
* Organizational units are now automatically set to match the organizational unit of the user creating the profile or entity. Organizational units can no longer be removed and left empty.
* When publishing a custom resource, a confirmation pop-up is now displayed after preparation.
* The pop-up message which appears when a custom resource fails has been improved for better clarity.
* The expression editor in workflows has been improved to prevent execution errors. [New functions](../../automating/using/customizing-workflow-external-parameters.md) are available: they can be used in all the activities that allow you to use event variables after calling a workflow with external parameters. Additionally, a tooltip now displays in the expression editor with the function description. 
* New filters have been added to the list of transactional events. They allow you to filter the event configurations according to their status, as well as the last time an event was received.
* The logs displaying when exporting packages have been made more specific and detailed about the encountered errors in case of failure.
* After sending a message, you can now search, filter and export the list of [tracked URLs](../../sending/using/tracking-messages.md).
* Automatic [synchronization between Launch and Campaign](../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application.md#aepsdk-workflow) is now GA and enabled by default.
* The size of workflow export packages has been optimized by removing the sending proof export.
* A new message has been added to display the size of the downloaded file in the **File transfer** activity.
* Error messages for invalid session tokens have been improved.
* A new mechanism now prevents tracking events from proxies from being added to tracking logs and reporting.
* A new warning message has been added to help debugging data management activities connected to a delivery activity.
* Labels in the reporting workspace have been improved.
* A new validation step has been added to prevent the deletion of technical objects in transactional messages.
* A new filter on delivery status has been added in the **Execution list** tab of a transactional message to improve troubleshooting.
* To improve performance and optimize execution time, unused indexes have been removed, based on usage stats of tables identified in preliminary analysis for 350+ customers. Impacted tables are: nmsaddressStatus, nmscampaign, nmsdelivery, nmslandingpage, nmsprogram, nmsrecipient, nmsseedmember, nmsservice, nmssubhistorcp, nmsaudience, xtkworkflow
