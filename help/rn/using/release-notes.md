**Improvements**

* The Delivery log ID (which is a unique identifier for each log) is now available in the Delivery logs and Tracking logs resources for all targeting dimensions. This enables to identify sending or tracking logs when exporting for example.

**Email Designer enhancements**

* Fixed an issue with accessibility ensuring that alternative text is available for images.
* Fixed an issue with the auto Calendar pop-up to allow users to dismiss content that appears on hover in marketing activities.
* Fixed an issue with accessibility ensuring that instructive text is placed at the beginning of the Audiences form.

* Fixed an issue where headers are not aligned with the content on the Service Summary report. (CAMP-38103)

**Patches**

* Fixed an issue in the **[!UICONTROL External API]** activity that displayed the **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** button even when * no data was modified.
* The "Deliveries with preparation failed"  filter now takes into account the deliveries creation date rather than the last modification date. 
* Fixed an issue when using an **[!UICONTROL Union]** activity on queries with different target dimensions. The transition data only showed records from the main set's targeting dimension.  (CAMP-36831)
* Fixed an issue that could lead to an error when using a **[!UICONTROL]**Reconciiliation activity in specific contexts, for example with two inbound activities, one of them being an exclusion activity. (CAMP-37490)
