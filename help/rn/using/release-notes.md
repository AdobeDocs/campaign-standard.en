**Improvements**

* Timezone management has been enhanced. You can now define a [specific timezone](../../automating/using/building-a-workflow.md) for an entire workflow. The selected timezone will apply to all the workflow's activities. Information about the timezone that has been configured for the operator or the server is now displayed in the interface (in logs, and after selecting a timezone). (CAMP-37672)

* Campaign Standard APIs now allow you to perform pagination when using large tables, by adding the `_forcePagination=true parameter` to your call URL. [Read more](../../api/using/pagination.md)

* The Delivery log ID (which is a unique identifier for each log) is now available in the Delivery logs and Tracking logs resources for all targeting dimensions. This enables to identify sending or tracking logs when exporting, for example.

**Email Designer enhancements**

* Fixed an issue which led to accessibility problems when resizing text in a container element.
* Added missing mandatory text instruction when creating an Audience.
* Fixed an issue which prevented users from dismissing the auto Calendar pop-up that appears on hover in marketing activities.
* Fixed an issue when clicking on the **Change content** button in the wizard of the legacy email editor.
* Fixed an issue which prevented headers from being aligned with the content on the Service Summary report. (CAMP-38103)
* Fixed an issue which prevented dynamic content variants from being deleted without affecting the rest of the subject line. (CAMP-40096)
* Fixed an A/B testing issue when using the B variant on the subject line. (CAMP-40327)
* Fixed an issue which prevented you from dragging and dropping files when using the Upload HTML import feature. (CAMP-39326)
* Fixed an issue which prevented you from copying and pasting text from a text editor. (CAMP-39028)
* Fixed an issue which prevented the word suggestions from being displayed. (CAMP-38970)
* Fixed an issue which prevented users from saving fragments. (ATU-2447)

**Other changes**

* The "Deliveries with preparation failed" filter now takes into account the deliveries' creation date rather than the last modification date. 
* The Organizational unit of the Administrators security group can no longer be changed.
* When creating a profile, the Organizational unit field must now be filled. 
* An Experience Cloud Trigger can now only be deleted if both the event and the transactional template that are linked to it are deleted.

**Patches**

* Fixed an issue in the **[!UICONTROL External API]** activity which displayed the **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** button even when no data was modified.
* Fixed an issue when using an **[!UICONTROL Union]** activity on queries with different target dimensions. The transition data only showed records from the main set's targeting dimension. (CAMP-36831)
* Fixed an issue that could lead to an error when using a **[!UICONTROL Reconciliation]** activity in specific contexts, for example with two inbound activities, one of them being an exclusion activity. (CAMP-37490)
* Fixed performance issues that could occur when selecting and updating test profiles. (CAMP-37976)
* Fixed an issue that could display error pages when subscribing or unsubscribing via landing pages. (CAMP-37771)

* Fixed an issue that prevented In-app messages from being sent when adding a test profile to the delivery.
* Fixed an error with the External API workflow activity which failed when linked to enrichment activities.
* Fixed an issue which could cause the status of SMS messages to be displayed incorrectly.
* Fixed an issue with custom resources which caused duplicate entries to appear under different API endpoints.
* Fixed an issue which prevented landing pages from being available after publishing. (CAMP-38695)
* Fixed a bug which occurred when displaying data from an Intersection transition coming from two different resources. (CAMP-38974)
* Fixed an issue which caused the enumeration value in a delivery template to default to a different one than the one configured. (CAMP-38388)

* Fixed an error which displayed the sender domain incorrectly in Dynamic reporting. (CAMP-33123)
* Fixed an issue which caused discrepancy in Unsubscription counts in Dynamic reporting. (CAMP-39949)
