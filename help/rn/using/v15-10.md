# v15.10

11/17/2015

## Improvements

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Workflows: Deduplication activity  | A new activity dedicated to deduplicating data is now available in the workflows. This activity allows you to filter any duplicates in your targets according to your chosen criteria. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/deduplication.md).  |
|  Workflows: Improved diagram  | From the workflow workspace, you can now use several keyboard shortcuts to select, open, and delete activities. Activity alignment has also been improved and allows a workflow to be better visually organized. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/workflow-interface.md#workspace).  |
|  Workflows: Extract file activity  | The date and time of the export is now automatically added to the labels of the files exported using an **Extract file** activity. This way the files generated are unique.  |
|  Simplified data import  | The name of the template from which a simplified import was carried out is now visible by default in the import list and in the detail of each import.  |
|  Custom resources  | Improvement and extended possibilities for managing and defining links for custom resources.  |
