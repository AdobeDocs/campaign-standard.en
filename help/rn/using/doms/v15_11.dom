    <tr> 
     <td> SMS Channel </td> 
     <td> You can now send SMS messages with Adobe Campaign. Just as for emails, you can create new SMS deliveries from your campaigns and from the list of marketing activities. You can also create single send and recurring SMS messages from a workflow. These SMS deliveries are based on templates that you can configure from the list of delivery templates. A default template is available. These SMS deliveries use the SMPP 3.4 protocol, used by most SMS routers. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../channels/using/about-sms-messages.md">detailed documentation</a>. </td>

    <tr> 
     <td> Exploring transitions </td> 
     <td> You can now explore the data and its structure in the last transition of a workflow. This allows you to check that the processes applied by each activity correspond to your needs. </td>

    <tr> 
     <td> File pre- and post-processing in workflows </td> 
     <td> You can now carry out additional processing on a data file when importing or exporting it via the <strong>Load file</strong> and <strong>Extract file</strong> activities. By default, you can unzip and zip a GZIP format file in these activities. For more information, refer to the documentation about the <a href="../../automating/using/load-file.md">Load file</a> and <a href="../../automating/using/extract-file.md">Extract file</a> activities. </td>

    <tr> 
     <td> Deliverability reports </td> 
     <td> An email rendering report is now available. This report allows you to view the different renderings of a message according to the support and message service used to read it. The report summary also presents the number of received messages, spam messages, unreceived messages, and messages awaiting reception. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../sending/using/email-rendering.md#email-rendering-report-description">detailed documentation</a>. </td>

     <td> Quick actions </td> 
     <td> Certain actions appear when hovering over or after selecting an element in a list or a workflow. Some of these actions are now displayed as icons around the elements concerned in order to facilitate access. These quick actions can be used to duplicate an element, delete it, show the detail, etc. </td>
