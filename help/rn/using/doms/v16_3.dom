     <td> Interface and navigation </td> 
     <td> The Adobe Campaign interface was improved to make navigation and operations simple and intuitive. You now navigate from the top bar of the application. The advanced menus are accessible by selecting the <strong>Adobe Campaign</strong> logo. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../start/using/interface-description.md">detailed documentation</a>. </td>

    <tr> 
     <td> Workflows: Save audience </td> 
     <td> A new option, <strong>Create then update an audience</strong>, is now available in the <strong>Save audience</strong> activity. This option allows you to manually enter an audience label. If the label entered corresponds to an existing audience, it will be updated. If the audience does not exist, it will be created. In addition, the audience will be updated every time the workflow is executed (again). You can always select the audience update mode: complete the audience with new data or replace the whole of the audience data at every execution. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../automating/using/save-audience.md">detailed documentation</a>. </td>

    <tr> 
     <td> Workflows: Segmentation </td> 
     <td> The <strong>Segmentation</strong> activity now allows the user to segment the data of a temporary resource. For example: the data of an imported file. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../automating/using/segmentation.md">detailed documentation</a>. </td>
