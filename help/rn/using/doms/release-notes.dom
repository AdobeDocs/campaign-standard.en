    <tr>
     <td>Push channel Reporting improvements<br /> </td> 
     <td>Several enhancements have been added to Push channel reporting to allow you to measure user engagement more intuitively. With this release, we are expanding the list of Push channel metrics to three different metrics: Impressions, Clicks, Opens (App Open) to help you measure and analyze usersâ€™ interaction with Push notifications more effectively. Along with this, we are also standardizing the definition and implementation of these metrics. The Push notification built-in report has also been improved with commonly used visualizations and metrics.<br /> For more information, refer to the <a href="../../reporting/using/push-notification-report.md">detailed documentation</a>.<br /> </td>

    <tr>
     <td>Launch integration for Mobile App<br /> </td> 
     <td>This release contains the integration of Adobe Campaign with the GA versions of Android and iOS extensions for Adobe Campaign Standard in Adobe Experience Platform Launch and Mobile SDKs. These extensions support push messaging, in-app messaging, and mobile app profile updates.<br /> For more information, refer to the <a href="../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application.md#main-pars-header-49">detailed documentation</a>.<br /> </td>

    <tr>
     <td>Mobile In-App Messaging<br /> </td>

Secure handshake ensures that your users' PII data does not fall into malicious hands as well as enables you to maintain users' privacy on a shared device by clearing out message cache every time the user logs out.<br /> For more information, refer to the <a href="../../channels/using/about-in-app-messaging.md">detailed documentation</a> and the dedicated <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kt/acs/using/acs-in-app-message-tutorial.html">In-App tutorial</a>.<br /> </td>

    <tr>
     <td>Workflow enhancements<br /> </td>

For more information, refer to the <a href="../../automating/using/workflow-interface.md#duplicating-workflow-activities">detailed documentation</a>. (CAMP-20014)</li> <li>When using the <strong>Load file</strong> activity, you can now add a timestamp to the name of the file containing the rejected records. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../automating/using/load-file.md#configuration">detailed documentation</a>.</li> <li><strong>Query</strong> and <strong>Segmentation</strong> activities now let you enable an outbound transition if the activities retrieve no data.</li> </td>
