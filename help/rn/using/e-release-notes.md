### Improvements {#e-rn-improvements}

* **Integration with Adobe Experience Manager**. While creating a personalized delivery template for transactional messages in Adobe Experience Manager you can now select and use the personalization fields defined in Campaign Standard in a drop down.

* **Cookie expiration** – The default cookie expirations is now set to 6 months, to align with the French Data Protection Agency (CNIL) recommendations.

* **Profile Search Improvement** – Profile search has been optimized so that search timeout scenarios can be reduced

* **Localization** - The translations of the term "audience" when referring to a group of profiles targeted to receive a message were harmonized across all Digital Experience products for the following languages:

    * German: Zielgruppe
    * Brazilian Portuguese: público-alvo
    * Spanish: público destinatario
    
    These changes will be rolled out gradually with the next UI and documentation releases.
