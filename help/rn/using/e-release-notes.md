## Release 22.2- June 2022 {#rn-2022}

**Security fixes**

* This version comes with a security upgrade activity to mitigate the Apache vulnerability and make your instance environment more secure. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/technotes/technote-migration/acc-apache-upgrade.html){target="_blank"}


**Improvements**

* **Adobe Notification Service** - Campaign comes with Adobe Notification Service allows Experience Cloud solutions to alert users across Experience Cloud on activities that are important for them to know. Starting 22.2 version, the user experience has been improved: notifications are prioritized and product-generated notifications are separated from Adobe status announcements. In addition, when the notification refers to a specific workflow, you can now access the corresponding workflow directly from the email or in-product notification.  For more on Adobe Campaign notifications, refer to [Adobe Campaign notifications](../../administration/using/sending-internal-notifications.md).

* **Workflow delayed start** - You can now delay the execution of your workflows to avoid overloading. Enabled by Adobe through a dedicated option, this guardrail ensures that there is a delay in start between workflows. The feature options set the number of workflows which can run simultaneously and the delay (in seconds) between them.
