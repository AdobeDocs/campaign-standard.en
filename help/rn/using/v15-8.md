# v15.8

09/01/2015

## Improvements

|  Functionality  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Simplified data import  | You can now import data in a simplified manner. Users simply select a template that was predefined by an administrator and upload the file containing the data to be imported. A workflow defined in the template is executed transparently for the user, who can access the details of the result of the import as well as a log of any errors. The data from these files can be inserted into the database or serve as a means to directly create an audience. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../automating/using/using-import-templates.md#about-import-templates).  |
|  Creating programs and campaigns  | Now, campaigns and programs are configured so that the day they are created is automatically used as the start date. The end date is configured according to the start date, such as: For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../start/using/programs-and-campaigns.md).  |
|  Email  | The list of tracked URLs is now read only.  |
|  Transactional messages  | You can now manage personalized transactional messages for events such as password changes or confirmations following an account being created. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../channels/using/about-transactional-messaging.md).  |
|  Custom resources  | Several functionalities added such as: extending a test profile, status management, and deleting resources. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../developing/using/resource-statuses.md).  |
