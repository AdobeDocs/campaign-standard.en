Campaign Standard provides several ways of monitoring your instances to make sure that your system is healthy and eventually troubleshoot issues that may occur when setting up workflows, sending deliveries, etc.

## Monitoring the system {#monitoring-system}

**System notifications**

Campaign Standard interface provides a notification pane that allows you to be kept informed of what is happening in the system: events statuses, system updates, action required, etc. [Read more](../../start/using/interface-description.md#top-bar)


**Technical workflows**

Technical workflows are operations or jobs scheduled to be executed on a regular basis on the server. To ensure that your instance is healthy and functioning properly, you need to make sure that they are always up and running. [Read more](../../administration/using/technical-workflows.md)

**Control Panel**

The Control Panel allows you to manage several settings of your instance: URL permissions, check your instance details like your servers' build versions, monitor active profiles usage, etc. It also allows you to monitor the available space on the SFTP servers that are connected to your instance. [Read more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/control-panel/using/control-panel-home.html).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Control Panel is accessible to all Admin users. The steps to grant Admin access to a user are detailed in [this page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/control-panel/using/discover-control-panel/managing-permissions.html?lang=en#discover-control-panel).

**Technical objects**

The **[!UICONTROL Diagnosis]** menu is a key tool to monitor and analyze the different technical objects generated by the application: data schemas, web pages, batch jobs, etc. [Read more](../../developing/using/monitoring-data-model-changes.md)

**Export audits**

Export audits allow you to monitor the exports performed on your instances: files uploaded from workflows, list exports, and files downloaded from direct mail messages.
[Read more](../../administration/using/auditing-export-logs.md)

**Licenses**

With the **[!UICONTROL Licenses]** menu, monitor information about your instances: installed licenses, build versions and terms agreement acceptances.
[Read more](../../administration/using/licenses.md)

## Monitoring workflows {#monitoring-workflows}

**Best practices and troubleshooting**

Following best practices and troubleshooting guidelines when using workflows can help improve performances.
[Read more](../../automating/using/best-practices-workflows.md)

**Logs and tasks**

Workflow logs monitoring is a key step to analyze your workflows and make sure they are running properly.
[Read more](../../automating/using/monitoring-workflow-execution.md#workflow-log-and-tasks)

**Notifications**

Campaign Standard allows you to send notifications to supervisors in order to monitor your workflows' execution and see if there is any error that requires your attention.
[Read more](../../automating/using/monitoring-workflow-execution.md#error-management)

## Monitoring deliveries {#monitoring-deliveries}

<img src="assets/do-not-localize/icon_send.svg" width="60px">

**Deliverability**

Campaign Standard provides several deliverability tools to help you improve the number of successfully delivered messages: delivery throughput reports, sending time optimization, messages preview, email rendering, quarantine management, etc.
[Read more](../../sending/using/about-deliverability.md)

**Deliveries**

Once your messages are sent, detailed logs allows you to monitor the deliveries and measure the success of your campaign, as well as track the behavior of the messages recipients.
[Read more](../../sending/using/monitoring-a-delivery.md)

**Delivery alerting**

With the Delivery alerting feature, you can set up alerts that will be automatically sent to a group of users regarding the execution of deliveries: failed sending or preparation, bad bounces ratio, low throughput, etc.
[Read more](../../sending/using/receiving-alerts-when-failures-happen.md)

**Dynamic reporting**

Dynamic reporting provides various reports to help you being kept informed of how your deliveries are performing: bounces, most viewed deliveries by recipients, deliveries' throughput, etc.
[Read more](../../reporting/using/about-dynamic-reports.md)
