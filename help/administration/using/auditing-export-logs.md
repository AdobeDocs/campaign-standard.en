# Auditing export logs{#auditing-export-logs}

Auditing export logs

From **Administration** > **Users & Security** > **Export audits**, administrators can view a list of all the following exports, including their date and the user who performed the export:

* File upload from a **Transfer file** activity in a workflow.
* List export from a list or a sub-list.
* File downloaded from the delivery dashboard of a Direct mail message.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Other exports are not tracked. The list of exports is purged every 6 months by default.

From the left pane, you can filter the exports you want to display based on your needs.

You can export the list as a separate file, as described in the [Exporting lists](../../automating/using/exporting-lists.md) section.
