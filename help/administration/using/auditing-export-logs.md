Auditing export logs

From **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Users & Security]** > **[!UICONTROL Export audits]** , administrators can view a list of all the following exports, including their date and the user who performed the export:

* File upload from a **[!UICONTROL Transfer file]** activity in a workflow.
* List export from a list or a sub-list.
* File downloaded from the delivery dashboard of a Direct mail message.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Other exports are not tracked. The list of exports is purged every 6 months by default.

From the left pane, you can filter the exports you want to display based on your needs.

You can export the list as a separate file, as described in the [Exporting lists](../../automating/using/exporting-lists.md) section.
