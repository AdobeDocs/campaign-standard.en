# Target mappings in Campaign{#target-mappings-in-campaign}

Target mappings are technical objects used by Campaign in order to deliver messages. They contain all the technical settings required to send deliveries (addresses, phone numbers, opt-in indicators, additional identifiers...).

Administrators can access target mappings in the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Application settings > Target mappings]** menu.

Target mapping creation or modification is possible to cover specific needs. In any case, their targeting dimension should always correspond to profiles ( **[!UICONTROL nms:recipient]** table). For more on targeting dimensions, refer to [this page](../../automating/using/query.md#targeting-dimensions-and-resources).
