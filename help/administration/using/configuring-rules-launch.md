# Configuring Launch rules to support Adobe Campaign Standard use cases {#configuring-rules-launch}

In [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch], you need to create data elements and rules to send PII and other data from mobile applications to [!DNL Adobe Campaign Standard].

To ensure that all configuration changes in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch] take effect, you must publish these changes. For more information, see [Publishing](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/create-a-mobile-property#publish-the-configuration).

To create rules in [!DNL Experience Platform Launch], follow these steps:

1. [Creating data elements](../administration/using/configuring-rules-launch#create-data-elements)
2. [Creating rules](../administration/using/configuring-rules-launch#create-data-elements) for use cases you want to support:

## Creating rules {#creating-rules}

You need to create rules for the following:

* [PII postback](../administration/using/configuring-rules-launch#pii-postback)
* [In-App tracking postback](../administration/using/configuring-rules-launch#inapp-tracking-postback)
* [Push notifications tracking postback](../administration/using/configuring-rules-launch#push-tracking-postback)
* [Location postback](../administration/using/configuring-rules-launch#location-postback)

### PII postback {#pii-postback}

>[!NOTE]
>
>To send PII information from a mobile app to Adobe Campaign, you need to implement an SDK API. For more information, go to [CollectPII](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/mobile-core-api-reference#collect-pii).

To send PII data to [!DNL Adobe Campaign Standard], create a rule in [!DNL Experience Platform Launch]:

1. In [!DNL Experience Platform Launch], from your mobile application dashboard, click the **[!UICONTROL Rules]** tab.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create New Rule]**.

1. Type a name, for example, **Mobile Core - Collect PII**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Events section, click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

1. Complete the following steps:
    1. From the **[!UICONTROL Extension]** drop-down, select **[!UICONTROL Mobile Core]**.
    1. From the **[!UICONTROL Event type]** drop-down, select **[!UICONTROL Collect PII]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Keep changes]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section, click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

1. Complete the following steps:
    1. From the **[!UICONTROL Extension]** drop-down, select **[!UICONTROL Mobile Core]**.
    1. From the **[!UICONTROL Action type]** drop-down, select **[!UICONTROL Send PII]**.

1. In **[!UICONTROL URL]**, enter the following URL:

    ```
    https://{%%camp-server%%}/rest/head/mobileAppV5/{%%pkey%%}/subscriptions/{%%mcid%%}
    ```

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Add Post Body]** check box.

1. In **[!UICONTROL Post Body]**, type the following:

    ```
    {
    "marketingCloudId":
    "{%%mcid%%}",
    "cusEmail":
    "{%contextdata.email%}",
    "cusFirstName":
    "{%contextdata.firstName%}",
    "cusLastName":
    "{%contextdata.lastName%}" }
    ```

    The marketingCloudId enables you to reconcile your app subscribers with the recipients in the database and, as a result, is required. You can specify other key-value pairs as per your business needs. In the example above, Email, First Name, and Last Name are being passed from the app.

    The keys (for example cusEmail, cusFirstName, and cusLastName) should match the field IDs that are defined in your custom resource in the Adobe Campaign Standard instance. The value variables (for example email, firstName, and LastName) should match the keys in the JSON data that is sent from the mobile app while calling the AMS collectPII API from the app code.

    You can also pass Lifecycle data in the Collect PII postback or a different postback depending on your Event triggers. here is an example of the Lifecycle data JSON: 

        ```
        {
        "marketingCloudId":"{%%mcid%%}",
        "cusDayslastlaunch": "{%%DaysSinceLastUse%%}", 
        "cusDaysfirstlaunch": "{%%DaysSinceFirstUse%%}", 
        "cusLaunches": "{%%Launches%%}"
        }
        ```

    The data elements that are defined in [!DNL Experience Platform Launch] should be enclosed in double percentages, for example %%mcid%%, and context variables from app should be enclosed in single percentages, for example %contextdata.email%.

1. In **[!UICONTROL Content Type]**, type **application/json**. 

1. In **[!UICONTROL Timeout]**, select 0.
