# Data retention{#data-retention}

Standard log tables in Campaign have pre-set retention periods on them limiting their data storage duration, to avoid overloading your system.

Data retention configuration is set by Adobe technical administrators during implementation and values may vary for each implementation, based on customer requirements.

Reach out to the Adobe consultants or technical administrators to learn more about retention periods which apply to your environment, or to set custom retention periods.

Note that using standard workflow functionality, it is possible to set up retention periods for any custom table.

Below are the default recommended retention values for standard tables:

* **Consolidated tracking**: 6 months
* **Delivery logs**: 6 months
* **Tracking logs**: 6 months
* **Events**: 1 month
* **Statistics of event processing**: 6 months
* **Archived events**: 6 months
* **Temporary entities**: 7 days
* **Ignored pipeline events**: 1 month
* **Delivery alerts**: 1 month
* **Export audit**: 6 months
