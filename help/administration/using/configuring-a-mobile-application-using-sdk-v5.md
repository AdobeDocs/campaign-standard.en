# Configuring a mobile application using SDK V5

Configuring a mobile application using SDK V5

Customers leveraging SDK V4 in their Mobile Apps will require some additional configuration to enable their user base to incrementally upgrade to SDK V5 version of the App. This configuration will be provided with In-App GA release.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Both push notifications and In-app messaging are supported by SDK V5 mobile applications. This feature is optional and currently a Beta feature which can be subject to future changes.

In order to send push notifications and In-App messages with SDK V5 application, a Mobile App has to be set up in Adobe Launch and configured in Adobe Campaign. Follow the steps below to start the configuration:

1. Make sure you can access the **Mobile app** channel in Adobe Campaign.
1. Create the mobile application in Adobe Launch by creating a property of Mobile type. For more info, refer to the [Adobe Launch](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/administration/companies-and-properties#create-a-property) documentation.
1. Install the following extensions for your mobile app in Adobe Launch:

    * Analytics
    * Campaign
    * Identity
    * Mobile Core
    * Signals

   For more information on extensions, refer to the [Adobe Launch](https://launch.gitbook.io/marketing-mobile-sdk-v5-by-adobe-documentation/) documentation.

1. Configure rules for your application in Adobe Launch. For more on this refer to [Configuring your application in Adobe Launch](../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application-using-sdk-v5.md#main-pars_header_59).
1. Configure your Adobe Launch application in Adobe Campaign Standard. For more on this, refer to [Setting up your Adobe Launch application in Adobe Campaign](../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application-using-sdk-v5.md#setting-up-your-adobe-launch-application-in-adobe-campaign).
1. Add channel specific configuration to your Mobile Application set-up. For more on this refer to [Channel specific application configuration in Adobe Campaign](../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application-using-sdk-v5.md#channel-specific-application-configuration-in-adobe-campaign).
1. Implement SDK V5 in your Mobile application. For more on this refer to [Adobe Launch](https://launch.gitbook.io/marketing-mobile-sdk-v5-by-adobe-documentation/) documentation.

## Configuring your application in Adobe Launch

In Adobe Launch, we need to create data elements and rules to send PII, users' interaction with Push and In-App messages and other data to Campaign.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>All configuration changes in Adobe Launch require publishing for them to take effect. For more on this, refer to the [Adobe Launch](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/publishing) documentation.

To configure your application in Adobe Launch, follow these steps:

* [Step 1: Create data elements](../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application-using-sdk-v5.md#step-1--create-data-elements)
* [Step 2: Create rules for PII postback](../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application-using-sdk-v5.md#step-2--create-rules-for-pii-postback)
* [Step 3: Create rules for In-App tracking postback](../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application-using-sdk-v5.md#step-3--create-rules-for-in-app-tracking-postback)
* [Step 4: Create rules for push notifications tracking postback](../../administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application-using-sdk-v5.md#step-4--create-rules-for-push-notifications-tracking-postback)

### Step 1: Create data elements

Here are the data elements we recommend creating in Adobe Launch:

* **Campaign server**, which will be mapped to Mobile Core.State:com.adobe.module.configuration/campaign.server.
* **In-app tracking ID**, used to track ID for users' interaction with the In-app message, which will be mapped to Mobile Core.Event Trigger Data:Trigger ID.

To create these data elements:

1. Select the **Data Elements **tab from your mobile application dashboard in Adobe Launch.
1. Click the **Create new data element **button to create the **Marketing ID** data element.

1. To make the connection between Campaign and Adobe Launch, click **Save**.
1. From the previous window, you can now see that its **Property Status** has been changed to **Configured**. You can also verify that property has been set up successfully in Campaign, if Adobe Launch Campaign extension shows that the pkey, a unique key for refencing mobile application in Adobe Campaign, has been set up successfully.

   ![](assets/launch_3.png)

1. For this configuration to take effect, the changes need to be published in Adobe Launch. For more on this, refer to the [Adobe Launch](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/publishing) documentation.

## Channel specific application configuration in Adobe Campaign

Your mobile application is now ready to be used in Campaign for push notification or In-app deliveries. You can now further configure it if needed to create events that will trigger your in-app messages and/or upload Push certificates.

1. From the advanced menu, select **Administration** > **Channels **> **BETA:Mobile app (SDK V5)**.
1. Select the mobile application you created and configured in Adobe Launch.

1. In the **Device-specific settings** section of a mobile application dashboard, for each device, provide the application details, including the certificate for iOS and the server key for Android.

   Once your certificate is uploaded, a message will let you know if the upload was successful and will display the expiration date of your certificate.

1. Click the **Mobile application subscribers** tab to see the subscribers and other information on them for example if they opted out of your notifications.

## Deleting your Adobe Launch application

To delete your Adobe Launch application, you first need to follow the steps detailed [here](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/administration/companies-and-properties#delete-a-property) . Please note that this cannot be reversed.

Once your application is deleted, you can check in Adobe Campaign if your application's **Property status** has been correctly updated to **Deleted in Launch**.
