# About Campaign Standard settings{#about-campaign-standard-settings}

[!DNL Campaign] Standard comes with different application elements that can be configured to match your needs. You can, for example:

* Set up external accounts,
* Configure target mappings to manage technical settings required to send deliveries,
* Set up internal notifications within the application, etc.

These settings are available from the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** / **[!UICONTROL Application settings]** menu.

Additionally, technical options are available in the **[!UICONTROL Options]** menu, allowing you to configure the application more specifically. Some of them are built-in when installing Campaign, and others can be added manually when needed (available options vary according to the packages installed with your instance).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>These options are already configured when installing Campaign, and should be modified by advanced users only. If you have any question or request, reach out to your Adobe contact.
