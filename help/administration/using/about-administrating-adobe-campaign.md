# About Administrating Adobe Campaign{#about-administrating-adobe-campaign}

About Administrating Adobe Campaign

As a cloud-based solution, Adobe Campaign offers administrators different ways to configure the application. Though the infrastructure configuration is performed by Adobe, functional administrators can:

* Invite users to access the application and manage groups of users as well as their rights and roles.
* Configure external accounts, which are used to connect Adobe Campaign to external servers.
* Adjust and configure routing parameters for all communication channels.
* Monitor the platform by accessing technical workflows.
* Import and export packages as well as extend the data model to add new fields or resources.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you have questions or requests about implementation and configuration matters, contact your Adobe account executive.

The different Adobe Campaign admin operations are carried out via the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** menu. This part of the interface can only be accessed by functional administrators of the platform.

To access this menu, click the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign]** logo, in the top left-hand corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Administration]** .
