## Administration menu {#administration-menu}

The different Adobe Campaign admin operations are carried out via the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** menu. This part of the interface can only be accessed by functional administrators of the platform.

To access this menu, click the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign]** logo, in the top left-hand corner, then click **[!UICONTROL Administration]**. The different menus available are:
