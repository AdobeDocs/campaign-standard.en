# About channel configuration

About channel configuration

All communication channels in Adobe Campaign must be correctly configured to be able to effectively send messages.

The different configurations are as follows:

* Technical configuration of the channel, including routing, processing rules, deliverability parameters, etc.
* Message templates and properties. All messages are based on a template. Adobe Campaign comes with a set of predefined templates for all activated channels. You can duplicate and customize these templates.
* Message properties. When creating a new message, you can finetune the properties depending on your needs.
* Some channels offer additional configurations that are optional, such as Email BCC.

The **Channel** menu regroups the technical parameters linked to the different application channels (Email, SMS) as well as typology and quarantine management.

Administrators can access these configurations in the **Administration** > **Channels** menu.
